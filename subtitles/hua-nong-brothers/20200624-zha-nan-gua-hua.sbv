# 這個公的就是 沒果子的
And this is male. It has, like, no fruits.

# 這就是
It's ah,

0:00:17.500,0:00:18.000

That's exactly what we wanna pick now.

0:00:22.520,0:00:24.060
# 你看  這固就是傳播花粉的
Look! They're for spreading the pollen.

# 這公花 不摘掉也會浪費的
The male flowers, would become a waste even if they're left here.

0:00:50.280,0:00:51.900
# 太多公的了  不用那麼多的
They're are simply too many male. We don't need that many.

0:00:52.920,0:00:54.380
# 去搞幾個母的就行啦  (註︰這句應該是不完整的，所以不太明白)
With a few female, that's it!
