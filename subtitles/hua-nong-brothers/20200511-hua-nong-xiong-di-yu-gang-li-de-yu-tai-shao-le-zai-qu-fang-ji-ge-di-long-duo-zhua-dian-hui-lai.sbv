# 华农兄弟：鱼缸里的鱼太少了，再去放几个地笼，多抓点回来
# Huanong Brothers: There are too few fish in our tank. Let's place some traps and catch some fish.

0:00:00.020,0:00:02.360
# 這個魚缸那麼大  魚又那麼少
This fish tank is so big, but there are so few fish.

0:00:04.180,0:00:04.880
# 我去搞點
Let me get,

0:00:05.700,0:00:06.780
# 再搞點回來
get some more fish.

0:00:07.820,0:00:09.100
# 太少啦  不好看
Too few, it doesn't look nice.

0:00:22.880,0:00:24.620
# 這種地方很多那個蛇頭魚的哦
There are a lot of snakehead fish in this kind of ponds, you know.

0:00:26.300,0:00:27.580
# 把那草割一下
Let me cut away the grass,

0:00:27.700,0:00:29.240
# 我們好放個地籠下去
so that I can drop a trap here.

0:00:33.560,0:00:35.520
# 這麼多草  地籠都放不下去
It's not possible to put the trap with so much grass.

0:00:40.160,0:00:41.780
# 這個小地籠
This is a small trap.

0:00:43.320,0:00:44.660
# 這裡放個小地籠
I'm gonna put a small trap here.

0:00:45.700,0:00:46.840
# 加點料下去
Let me put some bait.

0:00:48.900,0:00:50.620
# 這個料是我祖傳秘方哦
The formula of the bait is my ancestral secret.

0:01:02.660,0:01:04.640
# 等它可以進去下裡面吃得去  (註︰是我中文不好嗎？沒聽懂沒看懂)
The fish can get in, go down inside and eat and whatever.

0:01:08.120,0:01:09.740
# 你看  剛好沉下去啦  這樣
Look! It sinks to the bottom, you see.

0:01:12.340,0:01:13.780
# 準備一個大地籠
Let me get a big trap ready.

0:01:14.480,0:01:15.840
# 這草要搞乾淨
The grass needs to be cleared away.

0:01:16.860,0:01:18.020
# 不然放不下去
There are no rooms for the trap otherwise.

0:01:23.980,0:01:25.480
# 誒  怎麼還是小的
Eh? Why is it still a small one?

0:01:25.860,0:01:27.820
# 有大的  裡面還有大的  還有兩個大的
There are big ones, there are big ones inside, two big ones.

0:01:28.180,0:01:30.280
# 沒  就4個  我剛放掉了
No, I have only four. I've already put them down.

0:01:31.560,0:01:32.760
# 再帶了兩個過來
I've brought two more here.

0:01:33.380,0:01:34.040
# 你在哪裡放掉了
Where did you put them down?

0:01:34.200,0:01:34.700
# 車裡
Inside the car

0:01:36.560,0:01:37.540
# 就用這個小的
So I'll just use this small one.

0:01:38.840,0:01:39.620
# 有貨的話
My love depends of the result,

0:01:41.120,0:01:42.280
# 小的也是愛
not the size.

0:02:05.360,0:02:08.320
# 已經放好兩個啦  就這麼小的潭有兩個夠啦
I've already put two. Two would be enough for such a small pond.

0:02:08.640,0:02:09.840
# 我們還放下面
Let's put more down there,

0:02:10.400,0:02:11.900
# 放下面放兩個下去
down there, two more down there.

0:02:14.080,0:02:15.360
# 你看  就那個水潭
Look! That pond,

0:02:16.000,0:02:16.620
# 去那裡
we'er going there.

0:02:17.180,0:02:18.240
# 肯定有魚
There must be fish.

0:03:35.540,0:03:36.080

Alright!

0:03:37.100,0:03:38.260
# 這個地籠放好啦
So the trap is placed.

0:03:39.040,0:03:40.320

0:03:41.440,0:03:42.600
# 肯定有魚的這裡
There will certainly be fish.

0:03:51.200,0:03:52.900

We need to take care of the garbage.

0:03:58.580,0:03:59.980

# 第二天
The next day

0:04:04.280,0:04:07.360
# 今天過來收一下地籠哦  就在那下面  看一下有沒有魚
We're coming to get back the traps today. They're right down there. Let's see if there are any fish.

0:04:08.480,0:04:10.280
# 按道理來說  應該有魚
There should be fish, theoretically.

0:04:11.780,0:04:12.840
# 不然沒道理呀
It doesn't make sense otherwise.

0:04:22.820,0:04:23.820
# 吃都沒吃
The bait is still there, untouched.

0:04:24.740,0:04:26.560
# 你看 都沒有哦
Look! There's nothing.

0:04:26.680,0:04:27.600

It's strange!

0:04:30.400,0:04:30.980
# 放回去
Put it back.

0:04:31.720,0:04:32.680

There must be fish.

# 沒有魚
I know it.

0:04:35.660,0:04:36.340
