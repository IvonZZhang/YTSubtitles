# 简介

# Introduction
# 江西南昌的早餐特色就是拌粉+肉饼汤！地理位置上和湖南省相邻，当地人的饮食习惯是都爱吃粉。南昌的拌粉，是素粉加上辣椒、花生、酸萝卜、酱油等调味品，只要3元钱。肉饼汤，是南昌瓦罐汤的一种，就是将猪肉糜放在瓦罐里，厚厚的一层肉上再加一个鸡蛋，直接在大锅里蒸熟。如果不加鸡蛋，则可以把肉饼加厚做成肉球，俗话说就是一个肉坨。一份肉坨只要5元，实在便宜解馋！
# Nanchang, Jiangxi’s special breakfast is cold rice noodle + meatball soup! Geographically beside Hunan province, the locals are all rice noodle lovers. The cold rice noodle in Nanchang is a plain rice noodle with condiments like chili, peanut, sour radish, soy sauce added on, and only costs for 3 Yuan. The meat pie soup is a kind of crockpot soup in Nanchang, which is putting pork mince into a crock and adding an egg on the top of the thick layer of meat, and steaming it in a large pot. If without egg, you can thicken the meat pie to be a meatball, which is called “Rou Tuo”. A serving of Ruo Tuo only costs 5 Yuan, so cheap and satisfying!
