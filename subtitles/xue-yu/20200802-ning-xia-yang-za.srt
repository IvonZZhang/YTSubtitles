# 简介

# 吃遍了各个地方的羊杂后，大家都说宁夏吴忠的羊杂最特色，于是乎今天就来到了这里。一路从甘肃过来的时候，路上的风景也是美妙绝伦，广袤无际的大西北有种神秘的色彩，忽而蓝天白云，忽而乌云骤雨，忽而漫山遍野的西瓜地，忽而一片荒野。经历5个小时的车程到达吴忠，黄河从这里经过，拐了一个大弯，从空中俯瞰，那曲段分外妖娆，奈何无人机飞的太低，没有拍摄到全貌。顺着黄河一路向北，尽是繁茂之景。书里说这儿的滩羊最肥美，这里的人最会吃羊肉，可以从头吃到脚，从里吃到外，连一碗羊杂都特讲究。羊肺要先灌入面浆，这面浆也有讲究，必须洗掉面筋才行，灌了面筋的羊肺叫做面肺，面肺和羊心肝肚头一起烩一锅，加上羊油辣子，一碗20元那叫一个过瘾，最主要的是这儿的羊杂是早餐就吃的，吃一碗羊杂，喝一杯八宝茶，吴忠人的一天就开始了。
# After tasting various mutton offals across China, people say the most special mutton offal soup is in Wuzhong, Ningxia. That is why we here. On the way from Gansu, the vast expanse of Northwest China has a fantastic yet mysterious style. Sometimes blue sky along with white clouds, sometimes rain following dark cloud, sometimes great watermelon fields all over the mountains, sometimes just a wilderness. The trip to Wuzhong took 5 hours of driving, the Yellow River flows here through a big bend. From the air, the Yellow River looks extraordinarily enchanting. The only pity was that the drone flew too low to take the full picture of the Yellow River. Following the Yellow River all the way to the north, all are luxuriant scenery! Some books indicate Wuzhong has the most tender Tan mutton meat, and the people here are the best lamb eaters, eating it from head to toe, inside to outside. Even a bowl of mutton offal soup is exquisite. Before steaming, starch water will be pumped into the mutton lung. The starch water is made by mixing water and flour then washing out the gluten. Steamed mutton lung after pumping starch water is called “flour lung”. The mutton offal soup is made by stewing the “flour lung”, with mutton heart, liver, head and tripe, seasoned by mutton tallow and chili. Each bowl of mutton offal soup costs 20 yuan, which is pure satisfaction. In Wuzhong, people a bowl of mutton offal soup with a cup of Babao Tea (a traditional assorted herbal tea) as their breakfast. That's how a day in Wuzhong starts.
