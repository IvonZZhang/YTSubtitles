# 简介

# 西宁地处青藏高原东部，这儿的温差极大，人们的一天是从一碗牛杂汤开始的。早上4点，天还没有亮，小店的门口就已经有人来等着喝汤了。一上午的时间，几乎都是排队的状态。小店不大，只摆了几张桌子，门口一口大锅，热气腾腾的汤勾人食欲。老板正在剁牛杂，排队的时候就能听见剁肉的声音。一碗牛杂汤的价格从15元到30元不等，附带一个大饼。买一碗牛杂汤坐下，抱着喝汤，那种辛辣的感觉一下就祛除了身体的寒冷，碗里有5种牛杂，个个都炖地软烂，一口汤一口饼，再冷的高原都变得温暖。
#  Xining is located in the east of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Temperatures differ greatly between day and night. People start their days with a bowl of Beef offal soup. As early as 4:00 a.m., even before dawn, many people have lined up for the soup. There is always a long queue in front of the soup café the whole morning. This café is not big, with only a few tables. The boiling hot soup inside the cauldron at the door whet people’s appetite. The keeper of this café is chopping the beef offal. When waiting in line, you can hear the cutting sound. One bowl of soup ranges from 15 to 30 Yuan, including a naan. Sitting down and having a bowl of beef offal soup, the peppery taste drives away the chill. There are five different types of beef offal in the soup. Each beef offal is cooked to tender texture. With a sip of soup and a bite of naan, the cold Plateau feels much warmer.
