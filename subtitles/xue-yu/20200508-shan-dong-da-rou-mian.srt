# Shandong famous specialty Da Rou noodle. A bowl of noodles is accompanied with a piece of meat. If you feel like the meat is too greasy, you can even add chili, ground garlic to eat along. That's the Da Rou noodles from Tengzhou, Shandong. The owner is an uncle who rolls and cuts noodles all by himself. Noodles are cooked in a big pot, where about 8 bowls of noodles are cooked at a time. Scoop out the noodles, pour in meat soup, and then add meat or eggs if you like. It costs you 7 yuan for a bowl of noodles and free for meat soup refilling, 10 yuan for a piece of meat, 1 yuan for everything else. Many customers say it’s delicious and affordable. Customers pack the little restaurant everyday at noon.
