# Shandong Small Town Gourmet: 1￥ "Kao Pai". Sell more than 2000 a day! And 46￥ braised chicken.

# 简介
# 在山东小镇上吃小吃，30多年的老店生意一直很红火，1块5毛钱一个的烤牌，外皮全是芝麻，吃起来非常酥脆，搭配山东特色羊肉汤，那叫一个过瘾！夫妻两人一天要做2000个，只依靠一个炉子，慢慢做出来，一天就要做12个小时之多！几乎做完一炉卖一炉！除了吃烤牌，还有烧鸡，大大的烧鸡，外皮颜色诱人，大锅先炖，再用老汤调味，同样也是30年的老店，店家做的味道非常好，一只只的烧鸡热气腾腾，勾人食欲，吃烧鸡不能用刀，必须用手撕着吃，鸡皮脆爽，肉虽嫩，不及皮爽！
# Eat street food at a small town in Shandong. A 30-year-old popular brand selling "Kao Pai", one for 1.5￥. Sesame all around and very crispy. It is especially satisfying when accompanied with Shandong style Lamp Soup! Husband and wife make 2000 a day with one stove. They cook it slowly and spend 12 hours a day in baking. One batch sells immediately after taken out of the stove! Besides "Kao Pai", there is braised chicken. Large chicken with enticing outside. Braised in big wok and seasoned with broth. It's also sold in a 30-year-old restaurant with amazing flavor. Hot chicken with steam attracts customers' taste buds. One must use hand instead of a knife to tear chicken. Skin is crispy and meat is tender, but I like the skin more!
