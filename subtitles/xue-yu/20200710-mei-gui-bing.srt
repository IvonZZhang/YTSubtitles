# 待会呢 我们要去吃的是玫瑰花饼

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,520
# 这个玫瑰花饼和云南的玫瑰花饼 可截然不同
The rose cake here and the one in Yunnan are totally different

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,600
# 待会看一看 庐山真面目

# 绝对会刷新你对玫瑰花饼的认知

# 里面有一家专门做玫瑰饼的小店
There is a small street food shop specialised in making rose cakes inside

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,320
# 是这种前店后厨的模式
Counter in the front and kitchen in the back

# 做好的玫瑰饼呢 会拿到前面切完再卖
The rose cake coming out of the oven will be brought to the front and cut into portions before selling to the public

It can only be cut into 8 portions even it’s already this big

# 刚才我已经偷偷吃了一两块
I sneaked two pieces just now

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,120
# 可能就是因为它太容易碎了

# 所以说 你看 老板都是提前切好
The shopkeeper has to cut the cake for you in advance

# 你只能从他切好的块当中去选

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,000
# 不能够再切了 再切就碎成渣了
You can’t cut it any further, or it will turn into broken bits

# 其实下面 才是它的上面

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,520
# 我说袋子的下面才是（玫瑰饼）的上面
I mean the top side of the rose cake is on the bottom of the bag

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
# 现在我把玫瑰饼正过来了
Now I have turned it over

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,200
# 玫瑰饼就是 没切的时候 外形像一朵花
The shape of the whole cake is like a rose before it’s cut

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
# 它的颜色就是 红 黄 黑相间的
The colour is a mix of red, yellow and black

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
# 外面是硬壳 烤的比较坚硬
The outer shell is crusty and crunchy

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,560
# 但是 它下面的内瓤是一层层的
But underneath the shell are layers of goodness

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,240
# 哎呦 一碰就掉啊 我们就吃它这一块吧
Wow, it’s so delicate. Let’s just eat it

# 玫瑰花瓣一片片 飘落在眼前

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,320
# 它这个玫瑰饼 算不上多甜
This rose cake is, to be honest, not too sweet

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,680
# （从外面看颜色）颜色和枣糕很像 闻起来的味道也很像
The colour (on the outside) is similar to the date cake, so is the smell

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
# 但是吃一口发现 它们的味道真的是截然不同
But once you take a bite, they have completely different flavours

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
# 像枣糕这种就是闻着甜 吃起来更甜
The date cake smells sweet, and tastes even sweeter

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,880
# 但是这个（不是）
Totally not the case for this rose cake

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,040
# 它的甜度只比  就是嚼馒头的时候
It’s only slightly sweeter than the maltose

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,200
# 那个麦芽糖的甜味稍稍高一点
When you chew mantou (aka Chinese steamed buns)

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
# 根本就不算很甜
Not so sweet at all

# 美食不仅可以吃 还可以用来享受
You can not only eat, but also enjoy this gourmet food

# 既有面包的暄软 又像千层饼一样的酥脆
Soft like bread, crunchy like mille-feuille

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,080
# 还有就是 像玫瑰饼的甜美
And sweet as a rose cake

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,440
# 刚才吃的玫瑰饼 吃的晕头转向的
I’m so confused by the rose cake I just ate

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,120
# 因为它的味道是既甜 又咸
Because it tastes both sweet and savoury at the same time

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,360
# 甜是很容易理解的 里面放了玫瑰酱
It’s easy to understand the sweetness as it has rose sauce in it

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,200
# 这个咸 我想了老半天
But I just can’t comprehend, from my perspective

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,680
# 好像不太明白 它为什么是咸的
Why it is also savoury

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,360
# 接下来雪鱼就是 返回原来的地方
So next, I’ll go back to the shop

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
# 问一问老板
And ask the shopkeeper

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,920
# 里面还有什么样的材料是我不知道的
If there are any secret ingredients in there that I don’t know

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,100
# 就是里面加了胡麻 还有姜黄 还有一种叫什么
So, there are sesame and turmeric. What’s the other one called?

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,720
# 红曲
Red yeast

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,760
# 这实际上就是 八月十五我们蒸的月饼变成烤的了
In fact, it’s similar to the mooncake. We just bake it instead of steaming it

70
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,640
# 蒸的东西放不住 这个能够放一个礼拜
Steamed foods don’t last long, but this cake can last a week

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,520
# 蒸的东西 两三天边上就干了
The edge will dry out within 2 to 3 days if you steam it

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,040
# 它就是 以前我们那用老酵面做的 发面做的
The dough is made from the old starter

# 全汁原味 就算绿色产品吧
All natural and organic. We shall count them as green products

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,640
# 除了了解里面放了什么原料之外
Apart from knowing what ingredients have been put inside

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,000
# 还意识到 自己原来吃了个月饼
I also realise that I just ate a mooncake

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,960
