# 简介

# “您还记得大明湖畔的夏雨荷吗”，是的，雪鱼又到了山东济南，来到济南最绕不开的美食就是牛肉烧饼！这烧饼就像西安的肉夹馍一样普遍！刚出炉的饼中间切开，把剁好的肉塞进去，满满的很厚实，拿在手里沉甸甸的感觉！一个单纯的烧饼是1.5元，夹上牛肉就是8元一个，牛肉是咸香味道，炖地软烂入味；烧饼都是从旁边炉子里直接拿出来的，很烫手，这热牛肉和热烧饼搭配一起，别提有多美啦。在济南，牛肉烧饼一般是作为早餐食用，一个就能吃饱，现在很多店铺也会营业到下午，一天都可以吃到。吃完牛肉烧饼，一定要来市区的大明湖散散步，呼吸一下新鲜空气～
# "Do you remember Xia Yuhe by the Daming Lake?" Yes, Xueyu has arrived in Jinan, Shandong. One dish you cannot avoid in Jinan is the beef Shaobing(baked buns)! Beef Shaobing in Shandong is as popular as Rou Jia Mo (meat steamed buns) in Xi'an! Cut the freshly baked Shaobing in the middle and stuff the chopped meat in. It is full and thick, and it feels very heavy in your hand! A plain Shaobing is 1.5 yuan; Shaobing with beef is 8 yuan. The beef is savory and fragrant, stewed until tender and delicious. Shaobing is taken directly from the stove and is very hot. The hot beef pairs perfectly with hot Shaobing. It is such a treat! In Jinan, beef Shaobing is generally for breakfast, and one is usually enough to feed a person. Nowadays, many Shaobing restaurants open till afternoon, so you can eat it all day. After eating beef Shaobing, be sure to take a walk around the Daming Lake and breathe in some fresh air.
