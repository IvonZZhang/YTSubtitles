# <大西北早餐真硬核，2米面条抓进碗，加羊肠卖11元！人多炉灶都坐满>
# Breakfast in Northwestern China-Lamb Sausage Noodles, 11 yuan for 2 meter long noodles

# 简介

# <探寻世界美味，从南吃到北，从白吃到黑，我是雪鱼。
# 从这期开始，雪鱼将开始新的旅程，探索中国大西北的美食风味。首站来到青海省西宁市，这是一个高原城市，昼夜温差大，整座城市沿着河流分布，两面环山，风景如画。早上起来，我就直奔一家西宁当地很有名气的早餐店，专门来吃羊肠抓面！顾名思义，就是羊肠加面。一碗素面是5元，加羊肠辣子卖到11元，3个阿姨在透明半开放的厨房里忙碌。这个面条的一大特点是特别长，需要用手抓到碗里，一根面最长可以达到2米，甚至3米，加上羊肠的面，需要在滚烫的热水里冒几下直到烫熟，最后加辣椒、醋等调味品，看上去非常诱人。老顾客除了要一碗羊肠抓面，还会点一碗牛头肉，牛头肉筋道有味，配合蒜泥辣椒的香气，更让人爱不释手。在西宁的早上吃这样一碗羊肠面，真是热量非常高，管饱暖和舒服！>
# Explore delicious foods, from south to north during days and nights. I’m Xueyu
# Starting from this episode, Xueyu will start a new journey to explore local delicacies in Northwestern China. The first stop is Xining, the capitol of Qinghai province. It’s a city on the plateau with a huge temperature difference between the days and nights. The city sits on a river with mountains surrounding. What a view! This morning, I went directly to a famous breakfast place for its lamb sausage noodles. As the name implies, it’s noodle with lamb sausages. Plain noodles is 5 yuan. Noodles along with lamb sausages and chili oil is 11 yuan. There are 3 aunties working in a clear, semi-open kitchen. The noodles are really long and they need to be grabbed by hands into the bowl. A noodle can be as long as 2 meters or even 3. The noodles with lamb sausages need to be blanched in the boiling water. Then dress them with vinegar and chili oil, giving them a appetizing appearance. The frequent customers often order a bowl of beef head meat with the noodles. The beef head meet is chewy and rich. The garlic sauce and the chili oil adds another dimension to its aroma. A bowl of lamb sausage noodles in the morning of Xining gives you enough calories for the cold. Make you feel full, warm and comfortable!
