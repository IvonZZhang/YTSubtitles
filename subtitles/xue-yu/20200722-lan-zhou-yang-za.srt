# 兰州人的夜宵干拌羊杂+牛奶鸡蛋醪糟）
# Lanzhou Supper: Lamb Offal Salad and Laozao(sweet fermented rice) with milk and egg.

# 简介

# 兰州人的清晨属于牛肉面，而夜晚属于中山桥！不过在去中山桥之前，我先去吃了一家当地的特色夜宵凉拌羊杂！下午过去的时候已经开始要排队了，赶紧找一个空桌坐下来。这家的特色是把羊杂凉拌着吃，不同于羊杂汤，干拌的味道要更加猛烈一些，辣椒、蒜泥几乎覆盖了整盘羊杂。对于羊杂里的肉类，可以自由选择搭配，不想吃什么可以不加。老板大叔手法熟练得切着羊杂，切好的羊杂装盘，然后下沸水中烫30几秒，出锅装盘最后再加调味料。吃羊杂不能单吃，配一块大饼，既能中和羊杂的麻辣口感，又能果腹，一盘羊杂一块大饼，岂不美哉！
# Lanzhou's morning belongs to beef noodle soup, but the night belongs to Zhongshan Bridge. We went to a local lamb offal salad restaurant. People already lined up in the afternoon. We were able to find an empty table. Unlike the offal soup, offal salad is the special here. It is more flavorful. Chili and garlic covered almost the entire plate. After chopping the lamb offal, he cooked it in boiling water for around 30 seconds. After that, he added seasonings. You need to eat offal with a flatbread. It not only offsets some of the spiciness, but also fills your stomach. What a dish!
# 吃过羊杂后，我又来到了兰州最知名的正宁街夜市，一座城市的活力大抵可以从夜市中看出来。这里挤满了逛街的人，几乎比肩接踵，很多人下班后约三五好友在夜市中随便找一个座位坐下来，吃烧烤、羊杂、羊头肉、喝啤酒等。我要了一杯牛奶鸡蛋醪糟，这个小吃几乎是这条街最热门的了。更多精彩内容欢迎观看视频。
# After having the lamb offal salad, we came to the well-known night market at Lanzhou: Zhengning Street. We could tell the energy of a city from its night markets. This place is crowded with people having barbecue, lamb offal, lamb head, and beer. I ordered a Laozao(sweet fermented rice) with Milk and Egg, which is one of the most popular desserts in this night market. More in this video!

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,460
# 除了位置不同 我感觉不到有什么样的区别
Other than location, I don't really feel any difference between those shops.

# 最后呢 我找了一家看起来还不错的牛奶鸡蛋醪糟来排队
Eventually, I lined up at a store that looks quite decent.

87

It is actually quite watery, not thick at all. There are some egg flowers on top.

96
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
# 可能每一杯的味道都不太一样
Probably because every cup tastes a little differently.

97
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,940
