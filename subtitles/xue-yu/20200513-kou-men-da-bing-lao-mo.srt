# “Stingy” 1mm-thin flatbread in Jiangsu, 5 yuan for a combo, 600 orders sold out every morning

# 简介
# 江苏徐州特色小吃，烙馍！烙馍是非常薄的饼，只有1毫米的厚度，擀制这种馍需要长时间的操作经验，新手很难胜任，一般在街头巷尾的小摊上还有人制作这种馍。馍的吃法多种多样，从早餐到晚餐都有不同的方法。比如早餐时刻，2张馍放在一起加一个鸡蛋，可以叫做塌烙馍（见视频，塌是一种烹饪方法，如山东塌煎饼），塌好的烙馍口感脆爽，早上吃一个烙馍，再来一碗辣汤，早餐就非常完整了。其他时间，还可以用烙馍卷馓子吃，口感是双重脆感，很多人也喜欢；徐州的炸串、烧烤也非常发达，不管是烧烤还是炸串，都可以用烙馍包裹着来吃，既方便又有饱腹感。
# Street food in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, “lao mo” is a very thin flatbread, only one millimeter thick,. Making the flatbread requires much experience and the beginner can hardly master it. Usually people make it as street food, there are plenty of ways to eat “Lao mo” from breakfast to dinner, for example, two “Lao mo” and an egg in the morning is called “ta Lao mo”(in video, “ta” is a way to cook, like” Shan dong ta Jian bing”). “ta Lao mo” are crispy and in good texture, eating a “Lao mo” and a bowl of spicy soup makes you a fully breakfast.
