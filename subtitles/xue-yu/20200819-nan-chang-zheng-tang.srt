# 南昌大锅蒸汤店，老办法10个土炉蒸300盅，早上喝没有，只能晚上卖
# Nanchang Steamed Soup in Huge Steamers! Traditional Clay Stove Steaming. Sale at Night Only!

# 简介

# 吃惯了大西北的牛肉羊肉，我就直接跑到了江西。来这里发现原来不仅广东有靓汤，江西南昌也有。在南昌，比较出名的是瓦罐煨汤，除此之外，还有一种是用大蒸锅、电饭锅蒸出来的一盅盅的汤。食材丰富，种类丰富，用老式样的土炉子蒸4个小时，满满是时间的味道。根据食材的不同，一盅汤从16元到128元不等。这些汤只在晚上售卖，一直到凌晨3点，一晚上的时间顾客们就要喝掉10锅汤，真的超级nice。
# After getting enough mutton and beef in the "Great North-West", I dashed to Jiangxi Province directly. I discovered nice soups in Nanchang that I used to believe were exclusive to Guangdong Province. In Nanchang, clay-pot steamed soup is well-known. Aside from this, there is another kind of soup steamed in rice-cookers or huge steamers. Various ingredients and soups were steamed in traditional clay stoves for 4 hours, making a delicious taste nourished by time! According to its ingredients, the price of each soup ranges from 16 to 128 yuan. The soups are only sold during nighttime until 3 a.m. The soups taste so nice that 10 steamers of soups are consumed in just one night.
