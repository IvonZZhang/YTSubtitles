# 在山东喝羊肉汤有多豪迈！羊肉切大块，大舀子加汤，花20元吃得痛快
# Look how grand it is to drink lamb soup in Shandong! Cut the mutton into large pieces, add the big ladle to the soup, eat it for 20 yuan
# 简介
# 好久没有出来喝汤了，这次来到离家2个小时的山东日照喝羊肉汤！这家店面没有很豪华的装修，
# 可以说是很破旧，来这家店的顾客主要是奔着味道来的，最低15元一碗肉，加汤免费，
# 大饼1元管够，咸菜免费自助！如果想多加一点肉，可以要20元，30元，甚至50元一碗的，都可以！
# 到了中午12点，顾客就像说好了似的一块都来了，排队是常有的事情，大厅里都坐满了人，想要找到一个空座还是不容易的。
# 一碗羊肉汤里，羊肉很大块，汤汁奶白色，吃一口肉喝一口汤，再就一口饼，真是很惬意的感觉。
# Its been a long time I haven’t drink lamb soup, now we drink lamb soup in Rizhao, Shandong where drive 2 hours from home. There is no luxurious decoration in this restaurant,
# I can say it is very shabby. The customers who come to this restaurant mainly for the taste. The minimum is 15 yuan per bowl of soup and meat, and add soup is free. The flatbread is for 1 yuan, and the pickles are free for self-service! If you want to add a little more lamb meat, you can ask for 20 yuan, 30 yuan, or even 50 yuan per bowl! At noon, customers came together, lining is a common thing, the hall is full of people, and it is not easy to find an empty seat. In a bowl of lamb soup, the lamb meat is very large and the soup is milky white. It is a very comfortable feeling to eat a bite of meat and drink a soup together
