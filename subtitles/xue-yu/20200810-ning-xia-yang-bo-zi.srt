# 宁夏特色美食凉羊脖子，直接清水煮，出锅只撒盐就很好吃
Ning Xia's special: cold lamb neck, gourmet that only requires seasoning with salt
# 简介

# 宁夏滩羊味道鲜美，口感不膻不腻，做手抓羊肉只需要清水炖煮，稍微加一些葱姜即可，出锅时候斩大块摆盘，最后撒上椒盐就可以上桌。羊肋排肥瘦相间，肉质软烂，一口下去羊肉味道十足，配合一碟醋蒜汁，味道更美。高级一点的吃货会对羊脖子青睐有加！羊脖子同手抓羊肉一锅炖出来，只不过出锅时间会晚一个小时，出锅后的羊脖子放入冰箱冷藏，冷藏后的羊脖子极易切片，大刀切开，状如雪花，夹起来吃一口，口感细腻入微，入口即化，神仙口感，而此时，几乎不用任何蘸料就觉得美味。
# Ningxia Tan sheep tastes delicious without bad odor and is not too fatty. Cooking Shouzhua (boiled mutton) only requires boiling with water with a handful of spring onions and ginger. After boiling, the mutton is cut into large pieces, seasoned with pepper salt and served. Marbled lamb ribs are tender and full of flavor, pairing better with a small dish of garlic vinegar. Advanced foodies favor lamb neck even more. Lamb neck is stewed in the same pot of boiled mutton, which only takes one more hour. The stewed lamb neck is chilled in the fridge. Chilled lamb neck is very easy to slice. Sliced with a cleaver, the lamb neck slices are as thin as snowflakes. Take a bite, the lamb neck slice is smooth and tender. It will melt in your mouth and bring heavenly texture. It tastes delicious even without any seasoning.
