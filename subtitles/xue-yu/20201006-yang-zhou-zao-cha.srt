# 在扬州吃早餐，本地人推荐我来品尝早茶，清晨7点多钟，我就来到了一处茶楼！一入大厅，就觉得环境雅致，来吃早茶的顾客络绎不绝，大厅里几乎没有空桌。
# 终于找到一处坐下来，服务员热情相迎，桌布干净如新，餐具明亮，菜单上有100多钟点心可以选择，我想吃的这里都有，
# 我点了蟹黄汤包、三丁肉包、松仁烧麦、千层油糕、烫干丝和一壶茶，一共消费89元。
# 旁边很多大桌都被本地的大爷大妈使用着，和他们一起吃早茶，突然能感觉到扬州人的闲情逸致。

# Locals in Yangzhou recommended dim sum as my breakfast. At 7 o’clock in the morning, I arrived at this restaurant.
# It is a magnificent building with elegant fixture and fittings. It is already packed with people come for dim sum, and nearly all the tables are full.
# A waiter greeted me with a warm welcome and found me a table. The table is spotless clean.
# With more than 100 choices of dim sum, I finally can have anything I want here.

# I ordered a crab meat consommé in steamed bun, a steamed bun with three fillings,
# siu mai with pine nuts, thousand layered cake, dried bean curd threads in consommé and a pot of tea. It only costed me RMB89!
