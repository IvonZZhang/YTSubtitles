I’m in Lanzhou now and how can we skip the Lanzhou beef noodles

# 但是 你走在大街小巷上 你会发现

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
# 而都是牛肉面
They all say beef noodles

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,400
# 接下来我将去后面的牛肉面馆 看一看
Let’s have a look in this beef noodles restaurant behind

00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,320
# 看我后面这一米大锅里 他们炖了好多的牛肉
They are stewing so much beef in the meter-round pot behind me

13
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,720
# 这个汤就是待会牛肉面的底汤
The soup will be the base for the beef noodles

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,920
# 不过比起牛肉 我相信很多人和我一样
But I believe lots of people like myself are more interested in how they make the noodles

# 四绿就是 蒜苗韭菜翠绿

22
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,480
# 五黄是因为面条里面加了蓬灰
Finally, the noodles are yellow because of the baking soda in them

23
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,400
# 所以呢 面条显示出微微的淡黄色

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
# 面条并没有想象当中的 很有嚼头

32
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,760
# 反而是咬一口 很容易咬断

38
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,040
# 牛肉面 不应该有肉吗

39
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,440
# 找一找 有没有牛受的皮外伤的肉

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,760
# 看来就是一碗8块钱的牛肉面 是没有牛肉的
It seems that the 8 yuan beef noodles don’t have beef

41

You can order one liang (50 grams) and that’s one small plate

45
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,000
# 我现在要把它变成 豪华牛肉面

46
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,120
# 一般来说 都是实物与图片不符

The only downside of this much meat is I can’t reach the noodles now

55
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,680
# 这句话好像是在炫耀

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,760
# 他们这边的面条 粗细是分很多种规格的

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,040
# 有这种大力气的人才能够拉得动那么长的面

65
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,480
# 但实际上 做面的是一个比较精瘦的小哥
