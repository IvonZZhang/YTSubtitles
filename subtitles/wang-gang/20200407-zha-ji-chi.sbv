# 厨师长分享：“炸鸡翅”的简单快捷做法，外壳酥脆，肉汁丰富，四伯评价很高！
# Chef Wang shares with you: easy “Fried Chicken Wings”, juicy, tender and highly rated

# 简介
# 四伯四伯娘没怎么出过老家，真的没吃过肯德基麦当劳，
# Uncle and aunt have never really left the hometown, and never had KFC or McDonald’s.

# 但总觉得有机会可以让老人们了解一下现在年轻人吃的东西，
# I alway feel like if there’s a chance, I'd like the elderly to know what younger generations like to eat,

# 看看年轻人都拿什么来配啤酒😂
# and what the young people love to eat with beer.

# 其实效果还不错，四伯给的评价还是很高的，
# It’s actually not bad, uncle spoke highly of it.

# 果真食物是不分国界的，好吃就是好吃！
# Truly there is no border between food, delicious food is simply delicious food!

# 当然这炸鸡翅的做法肯定不是为了复制肯德基或者麦当劳，
# Of course, the fried chicken wing recipe is not for replicating KFC or McDonald’s.

# 只是给大家分享一个简单快捷的做法，
# I am just sharing a simple and easy way to make fried chicken wings.

# 毕竟这道菜好不好吃在于火候，做到外壳酥脆，
# After all, whether or not the dish is delicious depends on a proper cooking process, to achieve crispness on the outside, juiciness on the inside,

# 肉不柴并且脱骨，就一定会好吃，
# tenderness in the texture and ease to bite off, it will be very tasty.

# 希望大家喜欢，有机会也可以在家尝试。
# I hope everyone will like it and try it at home.

# 好 我先把它腌一下
Alright, let’s marinate them first

# 然后我们调这个糊用的鸡蛋哦四伯爷
Now we are using eggs to make the batter, uncle

# 抓一把面粉 大概半斤\

0:01:13.150,0:01:16.525
# 然后我们再放一点牛奶 这样炸出来更香
Then we add some milk, it will make them smell better

# 然后把它搅拌均匀
Mix it very well

0:01:23.050,0:01:24.075
# 嗯 可以了
Okay finished

0:01:24.325,0:01:26.475
# 盛起来它能够成1条线下去就可以了
After we scoop the batter, it pours down in a straight line then it is ready

0:01:26.600,0:01:28.700
# 然后我们再准备一点面包糠
Then we prepare some bread crumbs

0:01:29.050,0:01:30.275

Bread crumbs are different from rice bran

0:01:33.075,0:01:34.550
# 你不要以为这个是米糠
Do not assume this is rice bran

0:01:37.075,0:01:39.625
# 好 然后拿这个鸡翅出来
Okay then, let’s take out the chicken wings

0:01:39.775,0:01:43.375
# 把它的水份稍微地挤那么一下
Squeeze out the water a little bit

0:01:43.925,0:01:45.300
# 然后放到这个里面
Then put them into the batter

0:01:45.750,0:01:47.500
# 放到里面让它过（裹）一下
Coat the chicken wings with the batter

0:01:48.650,0:01:49.950
# 我们这个水份一定要挤干
We must squeeze the water dry

0:01:49.950,0:01:53.016

Otherwise the batter will become too thin

0:01:53.350,0:01:56.325

Coat the chicken wings with batter completely

0:02:04.008,0:02:07.368
# 然后我们上好糊了之后先暂时不要到（面包糠）里面滚
Once they are coated with batter, we do not put them into the bread crumbs yet

0:02:07.502,0:02:10.212
# 我们把油烧好了之后这样子拿起来
We wait until we heat up the oil

0:02:10.414,0:02:12.228
# 滚一个放一个 滚一个放一个
We can coat them with bread crumbs one by one

0:02:12.698,0:02:15.901
# 因为你现在滚了的话 弄得比较脏
If you coat them right now, it gets the station messy

0:02:16.954,0:02:19.216
# 来嘛 我弄过去开始炸了

You just tear it off. Do you want it spicy? I can get some spicy pepper flakes for dipping

0:04:13.936,0:04:14.559

0:04:21.200,0:04:23.024
# 好不好吃嘛 掰了来吃撒
How does it taste? Let's rip the meat off to eat

# 好吃安 好吃啊

0:04:26.428,0:04:27.249
# 弄点海椒面
Let’s use some chili pepper flakes

0:04:27.568,0:04:28.339
# 我不要海椒面
I don’t want chili pepper flakes

0:04:28.343,0:04:29.452
# 你不蘸啊 蘸哈嘛
Why not? Dip some

0:04:30.744,0:04:32.340
# 这个它放了盐（腌）的
It's already marinated with salt

0:04:34.392,0:04:35.683
# 蘸不起哦有可能
Too salty to dip more chili?

0:04:40.015,0:04:41.975
# 嗯好吃 不消蘸的
It is very tasty, no need to dip in chili

0:04:42.021,0:04:42.826

# 嗯 这个海椒面蘸起味道又不一样安
Un, the chicken wings taste different with the chili flakes

0:05:02.689,0:05:05.395
# 我们这个炸出来的话水份全部被锁在里面了
After deep-frying, we locked all the juice inside

0:05:05.455,0:05:06.854
# 里面都是很嫩很嫩的
It is very tender inside

0:05:18.890,0:05:22.184
# 我们炸这个的时候一定要开中小火去浸炸
When we are frying these, we must use medium low heat to fry them

0:05:22.249,0:05:25.790
# 如果是火太大的话 外面的糊了中间的还没熟
If the heat is too high, we might burn the outside while inside is undercooked

0:05:26.869,0:05:28.632
# 如果炖来干（吃）嘛还是绵的
If we stew the meat, it will taste soft

0:05:28.647,0:05:30.045
# 这样炸起还不绵
You fried it this way so the meat is not too soft

0:05:31.048,0:05:31.560
