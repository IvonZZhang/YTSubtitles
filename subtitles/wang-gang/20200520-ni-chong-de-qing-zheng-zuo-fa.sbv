# 厨师长分享：天然味精“泥虫”的清蒸做法，口感爽脆味道鲜美（四伯差点没敢吃😂）
# Chef Wang shares: Steamed 'natural MSG' (Peanut worm), crunchy and tasty (uncle was almost too scared to try)!

# 简介
# 大家好，今天给大家介绍一个可能内地朋友不太知道的美食“泥虫”，这种生物在不同的地区还叫“泥丁”“土笋”“土钉”等等，在东南沿海尤其是福建广东广西非常受欢迎，虽说看起来让人提不起食欲来，但吃起来却很鲜美，清蒸小炒做汤都是不错的选择，并且有“天然味精之称”。不过经过亲测要说的是新鲜的泥虫要比冰冻过的鲜美很多，有条件的朋友可以直接去沿海城市体验。
# Hi everyone, today I'm introducing a delicious ingredient, 'Ni Chong' (Peanut worm/ Sipuncula worm), which may be strange to those from inland. This species is also called 'Ni ding', 'Tu sun', 'Tu ding', etc. in different areas and is really popular in the southeast coast of China, especially in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces. Though it looks unappetizing, it actually tastes very good and is a versatile ingredient that can be enjoyed steamed, stir-fried, or made into a soup. Because of its umami-ness, it has got a nickname: 'natural MSG'. Personally I find that fresh peanut worms taste much better than frozen ones. Please visit a coastal city and give it a try if you can!
