# Visited grandmother with wine, who likes drinking and needs company

# 简介

# 大家好，今天去看望我的外婆，不小心居然爆料了不少外婆小时候的故事😂，真的是家有一老如有一宝（大家不要学我外婆啊😂）。其实老粉丝可能知道我的外公是老军人，小时候和他一起长大，有着军事化的管理，对我的影响非常的大，我一年多前拍过一期我回忆外公和去看望外婆的视频，大家如果感兴趣的话也可以去看一看，链接在此：https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwelRzrUK7Y
# Hello everyone, today we visted my grandmother and disclosed quite a few stories of when she was a child -- I want to say that it's really good to have an older person in a family (but please don't mimic her ;)). As most senior fans have already known, my grandfather was a soldier and brang me up with military discipline, which has made a huge impact to me. One year ago I uploaded a video in which I recalled my grandfather and visited my grandmother, so if you are interested you could take a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwelRzrUK7Y.
