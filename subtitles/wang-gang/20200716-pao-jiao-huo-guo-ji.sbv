# 简介

# 大家好，有朋友问买来的新产品“火锅鸡”调料具体怎么操作，今天就来用四伯养的鸡来拍一个简单做法，
# “泡椒火锅鸡”顾名思义其中泡椒和火锅为主要味型，泡椒选用“老坛泡红珠子辣椒”，酸辣适中回味无穷，
# 火锅料选用牛油熬制成的微辣不麻的香浓型底料。
# 如果大家买不到我的产品也可以选用“老坛泡椒”加“微辣香浓型”火锅底料来制作此菜，
# 成菜回味十足酸辣鲜香，喜欢的朋友不要错过！

# Hello everyone. Some friends have bought our new product, hotpot chicken seasoning,
# and asked about how to use it. Today we'll show you an easy recipe with my uncle's chicken.
# As the name "pickled chili hotpot chicken" suggests, its flavors are mostly pickled chili and hotpot.
# We chose "老坛泡红珠子辣椒" for the pickled chili, which has a mild sourness and spiciness and long aftertaste.
# The hotpot soup base is made of beef tallow, which is mildly spicy, non-numbing, aromatic and strong.
# If you can't buy my product, you can also cook this dish with premium pickled chili and mildly-spicy hotpot soup base.
# The result is still fully sour, spicy, savory and aromatic. Don't miss it!
