# 简介

# 硬核后厨正式回归！第一期拍得还不够全面，由于换了新的设备和后期流程，遇到了不少挑战，不过世上无难事，只怕有心人，相信会越来越好的！希望大家喜欢新的后厨和画面，我会继续努力给大家呈现更多优秀的内容💪💪💪这期还尝试了软字幕，如果需要字幕可以使用YouTube的CC功能，不知道这样会不会给大家提供更好的观看体验。
# Chief Wang has returned! The first video was not full-scaled, and due to the replacement of the new facilities, updating the back process, we met few challenges. However, no problems can’t be soved once we tried our best. There is no dounbt that it would be better!

I tried soft subtile in this video so that everyone could use the CC that is embeded in the YouTube for their own needs.

# 本期内容主题为“糖”，让大家更加了解不同种类的糖和炒糖的整个流程。其实糖色，拔丝，挂霜，糖衣等等这些看似高深的后厨专业术语，在了解其制作过程和原理之后就很简单了，研习此视频包你学会，要是还不会就再多看几遍😃
# Sugar would be this video’s topic. I want to introduce to eveyone more about the various kinds of sugar and the overall process of cooking with sugar. In fact, you will find that advanced cooking techbiques, including caramelized sugar, hot candied, guashuang, and sugar coating, are not as hard as they are sounded.
