# 简介

# 硬核后厨正式回归！第一期拍得还不够全面，由于换了新的设备和后期流程，遇到了不少挑战，不过世上无难事，只怕有心人，相信会越来越好的！希望大家喜欢新的后厨和画面，我会继续努力给大家呈现更多优秀的内容💪💪💪这期还尝试了软字幕，如果需要字幕可以使用YouTube的CC功能，不知道这样会不会给大家提供更好的观看体验。
# The hardcore kitchen videos have returned! The first video is not perfect, and due to changed devices and post-production process, we had a few challenges. However, nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it. Hopefully, it would be better and better! Hope everyone enjoys the new kitchen and videos, and I would continue to present more and better contents 💪💪💪.

# 本期内容主题为“糖”，让大家更加了解不同种类的糖和炒糖的整个流程。其实糖色，拔丝，挂霜，糖衣等等这些看似高深的后厨专业术语，在了解其制作过程和原理之后就很简单了，研习此视频包你学会，要是还不会就再多看几遍😃
# The topic of this video is sugar. I'd like to introduce to everyone more about the various kinds of sugar and the overall process of cooking sugar. In fact, you will find culinary jargon like caramelized sugar, basi, guashuang, sugar coating and etc simple after learning their cooking process and principles. By watching this video, I promise that you will learn these advanced techniques. If you don't, please watch a few more times 😃.

# 糖色的过程
Making caramelized sugar.

0:00:05.440,0:00:08.110
# 首先我们来了解有色糖和无色糖
Firstly, let’s have a look at colored sugars and colourless sugars.

0:00:08.580,0:00:09.640
# 有色糖大概有
Colored sugards include

0:00:09.742,0:00:10.638
# 片糖
Pian tang / peen tong (a Chinese brown sugar)

0:00:10.827,0:00:11.870
# 红糖
Brown sugar

0:00:12.020,0:00:13.130
# 土冰糖

0:00:13.220,0:00:14.347
# 无色糖大概有
Colourless sugars include

0:00:14.347,0:00:15.304
# 白砂糖
White granulated sugar

0:00:15.470,0:00:16.380
# 精炼冰糖
Refined rock sugar

0:00:16.945,0:00:19.658
# 其中冰糖又分精炼冰糖和土冰糖
Refined and unrefined and rock sugars are variants of rock sugar.

0:00:20.380,0:00:23.420
# 精炼冰糖的纯度高更透明且杂质非常少
Refined rock sugar has a higher purity. It is transparent and has very little impurities.

0:00:23.786,0:00:26.878
# 因为颜色纯净下锅融化得也更快更好
Its purity allows it to melt faster while cooking,

0:00:27.060,0:00:28.700
# 所以比较适合炒糖色
and therefore, it is a good choice for making caramelized sugar.

0:00:29.140,0:00:32.590
# 土冰糖偏淡黄色略带蔗糖的原始甜香味
"Tu bing tang" has a pale-yellow appearance, with the original flavor of cane sugar

0:00:32.860,0:00:34.500
# 它的优点是精炼次数少
It advantage is that with less refinement,

0:00:34.660,0:00:36.860
# 营养成分保留得更多更全面
more nutrients are preserved, in term of both amount and kinds.

0:00:37.326,0:00:39.101
# 但同时杂质也相对更多
In contrast, it has more impurities.

0:00:39.101,0:00:40.540
# 土冰糖比较适合熬粥
"Tu bing tang" is better to be used in congee,

0:00:40.637,0:00:41.446
# 泡茶
tea,

0:00:41.562,0:00:42.397
# 泡开水
hot water.

0:00:42.825,0:00:45.442
# 片糖的优点是方便储存不易回潮
"Pian tang" has the advantage of easy to store and hard to be damp,

0:00:45.937,0:00:46.940
# 相对比较硬
It is also more solid,

0:00:46.940,0:00:49.380
# 不容易化开适合广式糖水
hard to melt, so it’s suitable for making Cantonese desserts

0:00:49.895,0:00:51.431
# 红糖的质量比较松软
Brown sugar is softer, and

0:00:51.588,0:00:53.760
# 也是所有糖类中最容易吸收之一
It is one of the sugars that are the easiest to absorb

0:00:54.062,0:00:56.165
# 其特点是不容易保存容易回潮
It is not easy to store and easily get damped

0:00:56.756,0:00:59.200
# 白砂糖炒制的糖色色泽不如冰糖红亮
Caramelized sugar made from white granulated sugar doesn’t looks as red and light as it made from rock sugar

0:00:59.296,0:01:01.480
# 最常见的作用就是烹饪时候的调味
In cooking, it is most commonly used as seasoning

0:01:01.760,0:01:03.948
# 在这里不建议大家用砂糖炒制糖色
Therefore, it is not recommended to make caramelized sugar from granulated sugar

0:01:04.160,0:01:05.442
# 下一步开始制作
Then, let’s start

0:01:05.840,0:01:08.337
# 首先我们选择适量的精炼冰糖敲碎备用
We firstly break a moderate amount of refined rock sugar

0:01:08.610,0:01:11.703
# 这一步的目的是让冰糖在炒制的时候更快的溶解
This makes the sugar easier to melt while cooking

0:01:18.763,0:01:20.761
# 然后加入和冰糖等量的清水
Then add water with the same amount as sugar

0:01:20.980,0:01:23.980
# 新手操作建议糖和水的比例增加到1:1.2
For beginners, the sugar to water ratio could be 1:1.2

0:01:24.320,0:01:25.890
# 再加入适量的植物油
Add a proper amount of vegetable oil

0:01:25.960,0:01:28.613
# 加植物油可以提升炒糖色的时候的温度
Vegetable oil helps increasing the cooking temperature for caramelized sugar

0:01:28.760,0:01:29.893
# 下一步开始操作
Next, we start to cook

0:01:30.171,0:01:32.760
# 首先我们开中小火把调好的糖水下锅
Firstly, we turn on medium-to-low fire, and pour in the sugar water

0:01:32.921,0:01:36.232
# 糖水下锅之后烧开转小火边搅边观察糖的变化
After it boils, turn to low heat and keep stirring and watching

0:01:44.860,0:01:47.530
# 糖浆充分融化之后会起比较大的气泡
If the sugar melts completely, there would be big bubbles

0:01:48.040,0:01:49.950
# 然后继续熬至水分蒸发
Then continue cooking until water has evaporated

0:01:53.940,0:01:55.642
# 水分蒸发之后气泡变小
The bubbles will be smaller after evaporation

0:01:55.796,0:01:57.450
# 即可以制作挂霜的菜品
At this point, the sugar is good for dishes that need "guashuang" (white granular sugar coating)

0:02:00.760,0:02:02.988
# 继续熬制糖浆变成香油色的时候
If we continue cooking until the syrup has a similar color to sesame oil

0:02:03.140,0:02:05.180
# 也就是糖浆逐渐变成淡黄色之后
In other words, after the syrup has gradually changed to pale-yellow,

0:02:05.180,0:02:07.180
# 又马上可以进入拔丝菜品的状态
It could be used for preparing "basi" dishes (food with half-melt syrup coating)

0:02:13.940,0:02:15.330
# 好 我们继续往下制作
Ok, let’s continue.

0:02:15.740,0:02:17.670
# 再接着糖浆的黄色会加深
The color of syrup will be darker

0:02:17.740,0:02:18.660
# 这个时候的糖
At this time,

0:02:18.660,0:02:20.300
# 非常适合做冰糖葫芦
It is best to be used to make bingtanghulu,

0:02:20.300,0:02:21.370
# 冰糖李子等等
Bingtanglizi, and etc.

0:02:22.320,0:02:23.040
# 继续开火
Let’s keep cooking

0:02:23.080,0:02:25.480
# 略等十秒钟之后会变成初级枣红色
It would change to purplish red after about ten seconds

0:02:25.840,0:02:27.059
# 如果此时加入开水的话
If we add water at this time

0:02:27.059,0:02:28.720
# 就是略带甜味的糖色
It is the caramelized sugar with a mild sweetness

0:02:28.880,0:02:30.490
# 行业之中称为嫩汁
As a jargon, we call it "nengzhi"

0:02:30.700,0:02:32.530
# 初级变色之后将锅离火
Stop heating after it has changed color

0:02:32.840,0:02:35.070
# 利用余温将嫩汁顶呈深枣色
Use the remaining heat to bring the nengzhi to a dark purplish red color

0:02:48.460,0:02:51.230
# 深枣色之后再加入糖浆自身两倍的开水
Then add twice as much boiling water as the syrup

0:02:51.620,0:02:53.270
# 同学们切记不能用冷水
Please do not use cold water

0:02:53.540,0:02:56.070
# 冷水容易让高温的糖浆炸裂伤人
Since cold water will make the syrup splash and possibly cause injuries

0:02:56.300,0:02:59.114
# 也容易让糖色的颜色不融合导致分层
It may also cause a nonuniform color in the caramelized sugar, and lead to a layered appearance

0:02:59.340,0:03:01.830
# 加入开水之后也要继续熬煮一分钟
Keep cooking for one more minute after adding the water

0:03:11.665,0:03:13.240
# 最终的糖色无味
The final caramelized sugar is tasteless

0:03:13.240,0:03:14.160
# 颜色红亮
Has a bright red color

0:03:14.480,0:03:16.930
# 非常适合添加到卤味和红烧当中
And a very suitable to in master stock and red braised dishes

0:03:33.960,0:03:37.270
# 初次制作卤味的时候糖色需要慢慢的添加
In the initial making of master stock, caramelized sugar should be gradually added

0:03:37.620,0:03:39.450
# 直到颜色适合之后即可
Until the color looks fine

0:03:41.940,0:03:44.490
# 然后再加入配制好的卤料包和调味料
Then, add premade seasoning package and condiments

0:03:52.460,0:03:53.950
# 用糖色调色的卤水
When using a master stock made with caramelized sugar

0:03:54.040,0:03:55.053
# 需要注意的是
Please notice that

0:03:55.309,0:03:58.880
# 卤制的成品在出锅之后需要刷上一层油保色
The stewed product, after taken out of the pot, should be brushed over with oil

0:03:59.280,0:04:02.207
# 否则糖色很容易经过时间的氧化变黑
Or caramelized sugar will easily become dark due to oxidation

0:04:09.105,0:04:10.577
# 下面开始技术总结
Followings are technicial summary

0:04:10.577,0:04:12.040
# 糖水过程的质变
The process of qualitative change of sugar

0:04:12.500,0:04:14.340
# 第一水分蒸发之后
Firstly, after evaporation

0:04:14.380,0:04:15.900
# 气泡变小是挂霜
When bubbles become small, it is good for "gaushuang" (white granular sugar coating)

0:04:16.165,0:04:19.080
# 同学们挂霜也就是水分蒸发完的时候关火
To guashuang, turn off the fire after completely evaporation

0:04:19.440,0:04:21.270
# 下入原材料翻炒至冷却
Then add ingredients and keep stirring until cooled down

# 凝固硬化
solidated

0:04:39.752,0:04:42.083
# 第二糖浆变黄是拔丝
Secondly, when the syrup turns yellow, it is good for "basi" (coating with half-melt syrup)

0:04:42.306,0:04:45.139
# 拔丝原料下锅之前必须再加入少许的底油
We must add a little oil before adding the food ingredients

0:04:45.560,0:04:48.089
# 这一步的目的是让糖丝能够拉得更长
This allows us to pull longer sugar threads

0:04:48.500,0:04:51.198
# 成菜冷却之后且不容易粘连成一坨
and the food lumps won’t be glued up
