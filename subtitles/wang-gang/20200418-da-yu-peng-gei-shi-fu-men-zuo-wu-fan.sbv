# 听了大家的意见，搭雨棚！给师傅们做几道菜犒劳一下，以后再也不怕刮风下雨了
# We build a canopy following your comments! And cook a meal for workers. Weatherproof from now on

# 简介
# 大家好，之前不少朋友看到露天厨房就说是不是应该搭个棚子来，
# 的确亲身经历雨淋之后再次意识到棚子的重要性😂
# 所以下定决心请师傅们来搭一个，户外厨房又完整了一步！
# 在我们这边请师傅们来家里干活解决午饭问题是个传统，
# 那理所应当下厨好好给几位做些饭菜，吃饱了饭才好干活嘛！
# Hello everyone, many friends wondered if I should build a canopy or not after seeing the outdoor kitchen before.
# Indeed, I realized the importance of building a canopy again after my personal experience of the rain drench 😂.
# So I decided to ask the workers to build one. The outdoor kitchen is upgraded once again.
# As a local tradition, we treat the workers lunch.
# And I should certainly cook some dishes good enough for the workers so that they can work at their best.
