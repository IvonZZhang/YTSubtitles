# 忙了半个月首次回老家看望四伯，狗狗一时居然没认出来，见了我居然要咬
# Visiting my uncle for the first time in two weeks, and the dog has forgot me already.

# 简介

# 新工作室的拍摄流程已经步入正轨，终于又有时间回老家来看望四伯，老家的梨子，麦子和核桃都就要成熟了，狗狗居然都不认得我了😂，以后还是会经常回来拍视频，大家放心四伯还是会经常出镜的！
# The new studio has been set up and our video-making is back on track. I finally have time to visit my uncle. The pears, rice crop and walnuts are almost ripe. The dog doesn't recognize me anymore😂. I will come back often to shoot more videos and rest assured, uncle will be featured as usual.
