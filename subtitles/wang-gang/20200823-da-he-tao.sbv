# 王刚老家核桃树丰收百斤，爬树打点清香的鲜核桃给家人吃
# Chef Wang Gang climbed walnut tree to get fresh walnuts for his family, there are over 100 jin!

# 简介

# 又到了核桃丰收的季节，家里的这颗歪脖子老核桃树长在田埂上，每次打核桃都很纠结😂，不过每次把核桃铺满院坝的时候又觉得一切辛苦都是值得的。新鲜的核桃的果肉和经过晾晒的核桃有着非常不一样的风味，鲜核桃有着特殊的清香味也不会有油脂的味道，非常清新，大家有机会一定也要尝试一下。
# The walnut harvest season is here again, my family's "crooked-necked" old walnut tree grows on the ridge, making the harvest of walnuts very difficult 😂, but every time to spread all the walnuts all over the yard make me feel all the hard work is worth it. The fresh walnuts and the dried walnuts have very different flavor, fresh walnuts have a special fragrance and no fat taste, very refreshing, you should try them if you have a chance.
