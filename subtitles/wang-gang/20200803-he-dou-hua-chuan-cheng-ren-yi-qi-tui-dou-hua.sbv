# 简介

# 大家好，我今天特地邀请我的朋友李智来到家中，来答谢他之前为拍摄富顺豆花提供的帮助。他做为新一代的豆花传承人，依然坚持传统的做法和配料。我们也希望更多的朋友可以了解这门手艺喜爱这道美食。我作为厨师曾经学厨多年，但感叹于美食文化的博大精深，依然觉得要多多学习，学无止境！
# Hello everyone, I invited my friend Mr. Li Zhi to my home today to thank him for his help in shooting the latest video of "Fushun Douhua". As a new generation of Douhua inheritor, he still insists on using the traditional method and ingredients to make this dish. We also hope that more people will learn the skills and enjoy this delicious dish. As a cook, I have studied cooking for years, but I am still amazed by the vastness of the Chinese food culture and still feel the need to learn more, as knowledge has no limit!

0:01:51.433,0:01:54.431
# 感觉还是要用石磨推的没有那个粗的渣

# 我有好几回就是点到这个样子我就停了
For a couple of times, I stopped salting at this point.

0:04:23.420,0:04:24.556

0:07:29.508,0:07:31.976
# 现代技术的做出来有点（没那么好吃）
Modern technology makes it a little (less delicious).

0:07:32.362,0:07:36.374
