# 本期節目最後，還有大爺講述他和大媽的愛情故事。大爺大媽究竟是怎麼認識的，八卦的小友可千萬別錯過了！
# Hello friends! Previously we asked what kind of noodles you want to see. Some friends replied 'Chongqing Xiao Mian' (Chongqing Noodles), and here it comes!
# This time Da Ye's apprentice, Huang Guohui, presents how to cook Chongqing Noodles.
# With soft peas, aromatic sauce, al dente noodles, and incredibly fragrant chili pepper and Sichuan peppercorn oil, Da Ye and Er Bai enjoyed this dish so much. Though it's named 'Xiao Mian' (literally 'Small noodles'), never look down upon it!
# At the end of this video, Da Ye will talk about his love story with Da Ma. If you are interested in how they knew each other, don't miss it!

# 因为生的麻椒它的香味出不来

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,760
# 如果凉了香味激不出来
Otherwise, if the temperature is too low, the aroma will not be released

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
# 因为它比较粗一点
Since it's a bit coarse

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,360

# 你看国辉这个炒馅 炒这个还不一样

66
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,520
# 他是先炒酱后炒肉

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,120
# 也就是说能把豆瓣酱炒的特别香

# 而且它的肉质纤维没有那么粗
Also, the muscle fiber of this part is relatively fine

# 有电高压锅的最少要压四十分钟
In a pressure cooker, boil the peas for at least 40 minutes

87
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,760
# 芽菜一定要四川宜宾的芽菜是最好的
"Ya Cai" (Sichuan preserved mustard greens), must be from Yibin, Sichuan

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,800
# 一定要用水洗一下
You need to wash it with water

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
# 之后要放锅里面再用油炒一下
Then stir-fry it with oil

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,360
# 把芽菜本身的香味给炒出来
To bring out its intrinsic aroma

91
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,640
# 因为时间的关系
Due to the limited time

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,520

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
# 所有的调料把它组合在一起
is to combine all the ingredients

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
# 先调第一个麻酱 这是纯芝麻酱
First one, sesame sauce. Pure sesame sauce

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
# 纯芝麻酱有些太粘稠了
The pure sesame sauce is too thick

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
# 可以加一点点香油
You can dilute it with some sesame oil

102
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,920
# 这个的麻酱不能放太多
Don't add too much sesame sauce

103
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,160
# 太多的话汤它会太黏稠 糊的不清爽
Otherwise the soup would be too sticky. Not clear enough

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,480
# 就这样的小的勺子就一点点
Just a little bit with a small spoon like this

105
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,920
# 我们主要是起到一个增香的作用

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,320
# 我们只放这一调料勺就可以了
Just one spoon is enough

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,480

114
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,240
# 这也是根据自己的 对根据个人口味
-This also depends on your personal taste. -Yep, as you like

115
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,320
# 还可以放点花椒油
Some red peppercorn oil

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,800
# 麻椒和花椒
Green peppercorn and red peppercorn #我查了一下，貌似麻椒指的是青花椒，花椒指的是红色的花椒

117
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,960
# 它的香味和麻味它是不一样的 来一点点
They have different aromas and numbing flavors. Add a little

118
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
# 好了这是小面的简单的基础的打料
Ok. That's the simple and basic ingredient of Xiao Mian

119
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,000
# 提前我们就把它打好的卤
Before adding the noodles

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,240
# 我们简单的先加一点点汤把它拌匀了
we add some hot water to mix it up

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
# 要搁点骨头汤就更香了

122
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,320
# 锅已经开了
It's boiling

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,680
# 小面小面 他用的就是碱面
Xiao Mian, in particular, uses Jian Mian (noodles made with soda)

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,320
# 因为重庆和四川那边都喜欢吃这种碱面
Jian Mian is popular in Sichuan and Chongqing

125
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,680
# 其他地方没有这种面的话
If you can't buy such kind of noodle in your area

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,040
# 你买普通的手擀面条也可以
Just use common hand-made noodles

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,720
# 稍微细一点就可以了
It should be relatively thin

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,120
# 小面煮的时候不能时间长
Don't boil for too long

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
# 超过两分钟之后它的面会坨
The noodles will stick together if boiled over 2 minutes

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,160
# 这就是北京的话 锅挑儿
In Beijing, this is called 'Guo Tiaoer' (literally pick noodles out of the pot)

131
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,280
# 瞧瞧 这个还就是三两面
See? This is about 3 Liang (~ 150 g) of noodles

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
# 一会还有东西呢
We still need to add something later

133
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,840
# 炒好的肉末 芽菜 花生碎 葱花
Stir-fried minced meat, 'Ya Cai', minced peanut, minced green onion

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
# 豌豆可以打的时候带一点汤 为什么呢
When picking up the peas, you can scoop up some 'broth'. Why?

135
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,760
# 它本身压熟了 它会带一点甜味
Boiled peas give some sweetness by itself

136
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,520
# 非常香 看着就好
Very aromatic. It's already good from its look

137
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
# 这就是豌杂面 我拿走了大爷
-This is 'Wan Za Mian' (Xiao Mian with peas). -I'm taking this one, Da Ye

138
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
