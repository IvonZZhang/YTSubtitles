00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,160
# 咱用白胡椒粉补充黑椒的辣味
So we use some white pepper powder to compensate for the spicy flavor of the black pepper

79
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,520
# 但是又不夺黑椒的味儿 是吧
But it doesn't compete with the black pepper

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,320
# 干厨师以后我帮了很多人
I helped a lot of people (with their banquets) after I became a chef

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,000
# 只要有我在
'As long as I am here'

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,320

105
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320

5:40 am actually

147
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,680
# 外边这时候挂起了一个七级大风
Then a force-seven wind started outside

148
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
# 我一看不行
I thought that, this is not gonna be OK

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
# 这要在这里边有危险
It would be dangerous to have the banquet here in the tent

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
# 我就跟我一个旁边的刘大爷
So I asked my neighbor, Liu Da Ye

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
# 跟他们家商量
I talked to him

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,240
# 我说您的房子能不能借我使一天
and asked, 'May I borrow your house for today?'

153
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
# 确实
In fact

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
# 刘大爷和刘大妈毅然决然的
Liu Da Ye and his wife

155
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,080
# 同意了
agreed immediately

156
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,800
# 我特别感激他们
I appreciated their help so much

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,640
# 当时我差点眼泪都快出来
I almost burst into tears

158
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
# 然后从棚子里边
And moved the dishes from the tent

159
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,360
# 把菜端到他们家
into their house

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360
# 用咱过去那小的煤气灶
I used an old small gas stove

161
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,680
# 一桌一桌的开
To cook the dishes, table by table

162
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
# 开了是五回
So in total there were five times

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
# 一次开两桌
two tables of dish at a time

164
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,360
# 从上午十点开始开桌
The first dish was served from 10 am

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,720
# 一直开到晚上六点了
but the last one was served at 6 pm

166
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,040
# 就婚礼前您准备这些
You prepared all these before the banquet?

167
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,320
# 都是我自己准备的
I did it all by myself

168
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
# 那大妈知道吗当时
Did Da Ma know about this?

169
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
# 她不知道
No, she didn't know

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
# 因为她在北京么
Because she was in Beijing

171
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,680
# 婚事的在我们这
But the banquet was held in my house

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
# 您一直也没跟她说
You didn't tell her?

173
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,480
# 自己这些辛苦没说
about what you did?

174
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,800
# 我一看我出来以后
When I looked at myself after finishing

175
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,240
# 我跟土人似的
I was like covered in dirt

176
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,400
# 头天我还特别高兴到饭店
On the previous day, I was so excited when I went to work

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,280
# 洗洗澡
I had a bath

178
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
# 理理发
and a haircut

179
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,440
# 换换衣服
I also changed my clothes

180
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
# 等第二天
But on the second day

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,680
# 我干完这一宿饭菜的时候
when I finished preparing all these dishes after a whole night

182
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
# 第二天我一照镜子
I looked at myself in a mirror

183
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,440
# 我完全真的又累
I was so tired

184
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,120
# 又疲倦又困
exhausted and sleepy

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,240
# 再加上我在看我的形象
And my figure was...

186
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,320
# 人就变了
My figure changed

187
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,640
# 不像个新郎子
I wasn't like a bridegroom

188
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,120
# 洗完了以后
Then I had a shower

189
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,080
# 我就在这到车站
And went to the station

190
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,240
# 去接我的同事
to pick up my colleague

191
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
# 她（大妈）8点多一点
She (Da Ma) arrived at my home

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,840
# 到我家以后
at about 8 am

193
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,280
# 我把所有的饭菜
After I told my colleague about

194
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,600
# 什么菜都给交代完了以后
all the dishes

195
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
# 我说我不管了
I said, 'I can't deal with these any more'

196
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,840
# 我全拜托您了
'They are all yours'

197
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
# 他一直干了八桌饭以后
After he finished cooking 8 tables of dish

198
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,320
# 他该走了
He must leave

199
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
# 他马上得上夜班
Because he had another night shift

200
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
# 晚上还有两桌饭
There were two more tables of dish

201
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
# 谁来做
Who could cook those?

202
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,760
# 我就跟我妹又配合
So I was working with my younger sister

203
00:07:25,760 --> 00:03:35,200
# 就在我们家的小厨房
in the small kitchen in my home

204
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
# 在我们家小厨房
in my small kitchen

205
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
# 我是一边招待客人
I was attending to the guests

206
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,680
# 一边做饭
while cooking

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,080
# 做饭我还得悄悄的
But I had to cook 'screctly'

208
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,040
# 我妹我看着水锅
My sister was keeping an eye on the woks

209
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
# 看着油锅热了
Like, when the oil temperature was high enough

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
# 油锅热了我赶快进去炒俩
I went into the kitchen immediately to cook some dishes

211
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,360
# 水锅热了
When the water was boiling

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,640
# 赶紧去烫个菜
I hurried to blanch some vegetable

213
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
# 然后一炒
Then stir-fry some dishes

214
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
# 谁也闹不清楚
So nobody was clear

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
# 这两桌饭谁做的
Who exactly cooked the last two tables of dish

216
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
# 大妈也不知道吗当时
Da Ma was also unaware?

217
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,240
# 这个她知道
She knew about that

218
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
# 因为她这时候已经到我们家了
Because she was there in our home already

219
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,760
# 都忙活完了
After everything was finished

220
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
# 收拾完了
When we put up everything

221
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,320
# 已经晚上11点了
It was already 11 pm

222
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
# 该休息了
Time to sleep

223
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
# 人家结婚了
When other people get married

224
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
# 该入洞房了
It was time to get into the 'bridal chamber' #请检查这里，感觉怎么翻译都有歧义...

225
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
# 我入不了这洞房了
But I could not do that

226
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,960
# 我这两头两条腿往床上一放
When I rested my legs on the bed

227
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
# 我都不知道
I didn't even know that

228
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,160
# 这两个腿是我自己的
they were my legs

229
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,720
# 很沉重是吧
Pretty heavy, right?

230
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
# 然后我跟大妈也说
Then I told Da Ma

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,720
# 我说今天虽然是新婚的夜晚
I said, though this is our wedding night

232
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,320
# 但是我今天确实照顾不了你
I am sorry but I can't take care of you

233
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,480
# 我说我已经累了
I was already tired out

234
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
# 两个白天
Two entire days

235
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,240
# 一个夜晚36个小时
and a night, in total 36 hours

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,880
# 我没合眼是吧
I didn't even close my eyes for one second

237
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,360
# 所以大妈也流下了激动的眼泪
So Da Ma also cried emotionally

238
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,000
