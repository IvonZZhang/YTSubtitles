# 蘸完了我们入锅的时候

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,640
# 我们还得给它拍一拍 让它紧实点
We need to tap it to make the bread stick tighter.

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,920
# 如果嫌大 还可以改改刀
If you think it is too big, you can cut it to smaller pieces.

114
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,520
# 别改刀了 这吃的多痛快
Don’t need to do that. It is more satisfying to have big pieces.
