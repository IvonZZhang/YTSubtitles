# Intro
# Hi everyone, today we invited Chef Bing Yang, student of Da Ye. He will teach you a nice dessert for your home kitchen: the hand-made ice jelly.
# Ice jelly is a popular dish in Sichuan, suitable for everyone and it is perfect for hot summer days.
# The best ice jelly has to be hand-made, and it is supposed to be smooth and jiggly. Chef Yang will show us how to make the most authentic ice jelly, by hand. Here lists the details of all the ingredients.

# 原料：冰粉籽、石灰粉、砂糖、山楂粒、火龙果、葡萄干、花生碎、水果粒、醪糟

# Ingredients: Seeds of "apple of Peru (Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn)", calcium hydroxide, sugar, hawthorn, pitaya, raisin, peanuts, sliced fruits, LaoZao (rice wine distillers)

# 步骤：
# 1.冰粉籽用适量纯净水泡好
# 2.砂糖加水，上锅蒸10分钟
# 3.手洗净，冰粉籽拎出水上搓出果胶，更容易产生气泡
# 4.冰粉籽搓好后，加入适量石灰水，慢加快打
# 5.打好后，放入冰箱静置成型，取出装碗
# 6.加入红糖水、山楂粒、花生碎、葡萄干、水果粒、醪糟，即可食用。

# P.S（石灰粉是食品级熟石灰粉，只取用上部分氢氧化钙溶液即可）

# Steps:
# 1. Soak the seeds with clean water
# 2. Mix sugar with water and steam for 10 mins
# 3. Clean your hands and rub the seeds to extract fruit gel
# 4. Add calcium hydroxide solution to the extracted gel, then beat up the mixture
# 5. Cool in a fridge to form its shape
# 6. Add syrup, hawthorn, peanuts, raisin, fruits and Laozao.

You break the fruit open

32

So what are they used for?

39
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
# 它的果胶含量重
It is rich in fruit gel

40
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,080
# 就是能把水凝结在一起
Which binds water together

41
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,840

# 然后两个盆 一样放一个
Now we need two bowls, one for each.

48
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,760
# 最好其实是井水 井水安逸
It would be the best if we use mineral water from the well.

49
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,400
# 对
Indeed

50
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,080

# 咱们做两种今天
We are making two versions

56
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,720
# 泡一下
Let the seeds soak

57
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,240
# 大概可能是泡个五六分钟
for about 5-6 mins

58
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
# 因为它果胶含量比较重的话
Because of the fruit gels in the seeds

59
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,320
# 你稍微用水
You need to soak it with water

60
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,960
# 把它泡的时候泡一下的话
If you soak it

61
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,080
# 发得快一点
It absorbs water more quickly

62
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,240
# 那么现在还来一个
Then we have this

63
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,080
# 这个很有不一样的东西
Somehting sepcial

64
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,120
# 红糖
Brown sugar

65
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
# 他在四川叫砂糖
We call them “rock sugar" in Sichuan

66
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,640
# 它形状很像砂块
because it looks like rocks

67
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,840
# 你看
look

68
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
# 如果你在超市里面
if you buy it from the supermarket

69
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,320
# 或者在北方买的红糖
or the brown sugar in northern China

70
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
# 它是粉状的
It's usually in podwers

71
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
# 要不就是块状的 片状的
or in slices

72
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
# 然后其实我掰了一个角
This is only a corner of the whole piece

73
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,840
# 很大一块 用这个刀这样
Slice it like this

74
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
# 四川的红糖的话
The brown sugar in Sichuan

75
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
# 它比较香
It has a better aroma

76
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,640
# 因为普通红糖话
while the regular ones

77
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,760
# 它出来的红糖水是黄的
has a yellow-ish color

78
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,240
# 而且它香味口感 焦糖味不够
and the flavour is not strong enough

79
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,000
# 焦糖味不够
Especially the caramel flavour

80
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,080
# 四川的红糖比较纯
The brown sugar from Sichuan is purer

81
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,440
# 然后一般好多人就是熬
Many tend to boil it

82
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,160
# 但是我是拿着蒸
I prefer to steam

83
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
# 因为熬的时候
When you boil it

84
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
# 如果稍微掌握不好的话
If you are not experienced

85
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,480
# 它容易会糊掉
It might burn

86
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
# 焦糖就糊掉
The caramel may burn

87
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
# 会发苦
and get bitter

88
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,920
# 这是一斤的红糖
Here's 500g of sugar

89
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,200
# 配上二两水
with 100g water

90
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
# 好了
OK

91
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,320
# 马上就化去了

# 一般情况下蒸个10分钟左右就可以了

96
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
# 差不多泡了有几分钟了
We have soaked them for a few minutes

97
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
# 我拿一盆里面搁点果肉
Let me put some pitaya in it

98
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,760
# 对
right

99
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,360
# 差不多的量
something like this

100
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
# 我大概可能搁了有个100克嘛
about 100 grams

101
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,040
# 红的火龙果
red pitaya fruits

102
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
# 我这个先放着
Let it sit there

103
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,680
# 我现在搓这个
Now let's rub these seeds

104
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
# 这个泡了
after soaking

105
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
# 你看它里面开始起坨坨了
the seeds start to lump up

106
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
# 师父你看里面结块了
See the lumps there?

107
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
# 这个时候其实搓冰粉
There are tricks

108
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
# 其实还有一些讲究
in rubbing the seeds

109
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,640
# 如果说咱们在水底下去搓
If we do it under water

110
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,160
# 出来是没气泡亮的
There's no air bubbles and it's transparant

111
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
# 但是现在我们基本上
But what we do now

112
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,360
# 小时候还有现在不管这些商家
also the shops do it when I was a kid, but not anymore

113
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,160
# 咱们都是
We do it

114
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,800
# 是这样
like this

115
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,080
# 从水上去搓
over the water

116
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,280
# 待会儿满盆的都是气泡
Then there will be a lot of air bubbles

117
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
# 气泡一个是它有口感
the bubbles improves the texture

118
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
# 再一个是好看
and also it looks better

119
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
# 其实在四川
In Sichuan

120
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,120
# 不管大街小巷
on the streets and the little alleys

121
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,040
# 学校门口还有码头
outside school or at the pier

122
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
# 然后到处都有来一个大姐或者这个老太太
there are always someone

123
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,600
# 她就卖冰粉
selling this ice jelly

124
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
# 对然后好了
Ok

125
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,360
# 这稍微再搓一下
give it a bit more rubbing

126
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,440
# 包括这个也是稍微给它再搓一下
this one too

127
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
# 因为今天做的是两个口味
this one has a different flavor

128
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,920
# 对
right

129
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
# 幺妹儿买啥子来 买冰粉儿
"what are you selling? ice jelly!"

130
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
# 这个时候特别关键的一个东西
This is important

131
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,800
# 石灰5克
5 grams of lime powder

132
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
# 然后现在把水先放进去
then we add some water

133
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200
# 放半斤水
about 250 grams

134
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,440
# 其实在买冰粉的时候
when you buy the ingredients

135
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,160
# 他就给你带这个石灰
it often comes with the slaked lime powder

136
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,280
# 泡上
let is soak

137
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
# 放一边不用管它
and let it there

138
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,440
# 石灰是含的碳酸钙嘛
there are Calcium carbonate in the powder (此处存疑，因为前面说用的是熟石灰，那么应该是氢氧化钙，且碳酸钙并不可溶)

139
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,560
# 加了石灰水之后啊
once you add the slaked lime water

140
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,200
# 他就把那些一些比较发散的果胶
it will bind the fruit gels

141
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,800
# 跟水完全融合在一起
with the water molecules

142
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
# 才能有果冻的感觉
to form a jelly

143
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,360
# 混为一体
togehter

144
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,880
# 搓的时候
when we rub the seeds

145
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,240
# 其实就让他果胶充分得出来
we want to extract the fruit gels as much as possible

146
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,760
# 大概其实搓个几分钟就可以了
we need to rub it for a few minutes

147
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,080
# 黏了 对了
right, it gets sticky now

148
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,320
# 黏了特别黏起泡了
sticky, and there are bubbles

149
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,160
# 对
right

150

# 离开水这么挤
press it over the water

151
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720

160
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
# 沉淀不用管它
only use the supernatant

161
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200

stir in one direction

162
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,440

177
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,880
# 一边去拿去捏捏果肉
when rubbing the seeds

178
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
# 然后夏天的话

179
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
# 加西瓜也好
It's also nice to use watermelon

180
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,120
# 或者加火龙果也好
instead of pitaya

181
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
# 各种颜色哪个味道出来都非常的好
both will be nice in color and taste

182

189
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,680

how long can I keep

313
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,120
# 另外我们炸完葱油
Also, when you make your own spring onion oil

314
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,920
# 一定要有个盖
store it with a cover

315
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,160
# 要封着它
to seal it

316
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,640
# 或者保鲜膜给它封上
or use a film to seal it

317
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
# 不能让这个味儿
you have to prevent the aroma

318
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
# 全给跑出来
from running out

319
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:56,880
# 是吧
right?

320
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
# 所以要有个瓶
Get a bottle

321
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,360
# 有个罐
or a jar

322
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
# 一定要把它封起来
and seal it

323
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
# 能保住它的香味
to keep the aroma
