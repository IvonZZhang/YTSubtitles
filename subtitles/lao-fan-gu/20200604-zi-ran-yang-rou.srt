23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,720
# 实际上孜然羊肉应该是切成粒
Actually,  cumin lamb should be cut in cubes.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,680
# 实际上这个肉不是撑盘的菜 是要口感的菜
since the meat in this dishes is not for presentation, but for texture.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,920
# 我们这老大哥教的时候

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,320
# 他说你这必须要切成粒 要不然没口感

# 它这肉里边有纹 看见了么

# 这个肉 做孜然羊肉是口感最好的了

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,280
# 比纯瘦的好吃

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
# 这么多够了吧大爷 不少
Is that enough, Da Ye? It is quite a lot.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,680

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,240
# 咱打一鲜姜汁
let's make some ginger juice.

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,960
# 来一点点水
add some water

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,080
# 粉碎机
blender

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,920
# 这个菜 关键点就在这
the key for this dish is here

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,320
# 鲜姜汁进去就压下羊肉的膻味
fresh ginger juice can cover the gamy flavor 

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
# 然后提一下羊肉的香味
then the meaty smell will appear

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,400
# 咱这姜汁儿进去了 来一勺盐
after we add the ginger juice, put a spoon of salt

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,560
# 这盐得底口稍微足一点
we need add enough salt at the beginning

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,920
# 胡椒粉 白胡椒
pepper which is white pepper

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,440
# 这都是在腌羊肉里边必须的
these are all the must-have ingredients for marinating the lamb

43
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,600
# 搅拌均匀  别使太大的劲
mix evenly, but do not stir too hard

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
# 因为咱这肉块让它整点
because we want the lamb to be complete

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
# 然后咱们来一点点的酱油
then, let's add some soy sauce

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,840
# 最好黄豆酱油 味道还挺浓
better to use soybean soy sauce. It has strong flavor.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
# 这里边不要加鸡蛋
do not put egg

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
# 直接上干粉 玉米淀粉
use the corn startch to cover it

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,960
# 这淀粉不要太大
we dont need too much

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,320
# 也是抄拌 拌匀了它就行了
still stirring it. After fully mix, it is done

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,240
# 其实这淀粉是锁住原料的水分
actually this corn startch is used for locking the water inside the ingredients

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,520
# 另外增加原料的嫩度
additionally to keep its tenderness

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
# 还有起到了一个外焦里嫩的脆感
make its crust crispy with tender inside

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,680
# 待会儿滑肉的时候油温稍微高一点
When we stir the lamb cubes, the oil temperature should be a bit high 

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,040
# 比咱们滑肉的时候要高
higher than usual

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,880
# 拌点油 封住
put some oil , lock it up

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,560
# 这油可以大一点 没事
We can use a large amount of oil. It's fine

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,600
# 一会还回到油锅里头 一点不浪费
later we pour back to the oil pot which means no waste

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,560
# 别人的香菜都是切成段直接码盘底下
Others cut cilantro into peices then just put it on the bottom of the plate

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,240
# 当时我们老哥哥说你这个香菜
My old buddy taught me that the cilantro

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,040
# 只有把叶子给它搁到盘底下行
you can only put the leave on the bottom. 

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
# 因为它直接羊肉一腾它就熟了
because it will be cooked after you put the lamb on top.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,000
# 这个梗一定要下锅
stems also need to be used

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,320
# 它是什么 给它切成粒
what do we need to do with it? Chop it into small dices.

65
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,840

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
# 你看同样做羊肉 同样做孜然羊肉
See, people make the same dish, make the cumin lamb

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,120
# 每个人的手法都不一样
but people cook differently

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,720
# 今天我看到亮子这个手法还是挺新鲜的
today i found it is novel to see Liangzi's method.

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,280
# 你看他用的全是叶
you see, all he used are leaves

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,600
# 洋葱芯不要 咱们要它这个瓤
onion pulp, don't need. We need the outer layers

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,720
# 就是外边这层皮儿 芯儿太嫩
It is the external skin. The pulp is too tender

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,640

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,200
# 孜然 千万不要用孜然粉
cumin. Don't use the powder

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,720
# 孜然粉吃着到时候它糊嘴
Cumin powder will stick on your month. 

75
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,200
# 咱们要孜然粒 吃它那香
we need the cumin seeds. It is aromatic.

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,240
# 小火煸炒就行
use low heat to stir up.

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,920
# 大爷香味出来了 很酥了 差不多了
Da Ye, it becomes aromatic, seems like crispy, should be done. 

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,440
# 再炒就过火了 正合适
If we stir a bit longer, it will be too much. Now is about right.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,400
# 辣椒面要细辣椒面 香啊
chili powder, we need the finely grinded one. smells good.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,640
# 干炒也是 就是给它焙一下
also need to fry it without oil, just heat it up.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,680
# 因为把那生辣椒味给它焙出去
just get rid of raw chili flavor

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,200
# 要辣椒的香
we only need the aroma

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,440

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,600
# 咱们起锅烧上油
let's start cooking, add the oil

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,480
# 我做肉菜比较费油
I need a lot of oil when I make meat dishes.

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,280
# 因为有时候这东西少了油它却确实不行
since sometimes the meat is truely not so good without the oil

87
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,960
# 现在咱把肉一滑基本上就能吃了
now the lamb just need to be slightly fry and it can be eaten.

88
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,480
# 它就这几味料
only need a few condiments

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
# 实际上羊肉这东西料不需要太多
actually dont need too much condiments for lamb

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,400
# 吃羊肉的本味和鲜味
just taste the ordinary smell and umami.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,600
# 网友要在家做 就这几个步骤掌握好了
if you guys wanna cook at home, just know these steps well

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,200
# 这盘菜成功率很高
easy to success. 

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,480
# 这个放进去别着急动
put this inside, dont hurry to touch it

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,800
# 因为咱们肉浆的时候 这粉子上的就合适
Because we added the right amount of starch. 

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,680
# 不用复油炸 不用
Don't need to fry the second time? no

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
# 这个也不能把它的水分炸的太干
we shouldn't fry it for too long to loose its moisture.

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
# 因为太干了到时候没口感了
if it is too dry,  it will not have the right texture.

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
# 这就差不多了
here we go

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
# 搁盆里头
put into the pot

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,920
# 油温让它高一点 一次成型
Heat up the oil temperature, so we make it one-shot

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,080

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,640
# 这比第一锅炸的酥
more crispy than the first pot

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,000
# 为什么 因为量合适了
you know why , because the amount is right.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
# 这个看到了吧 就让它外边
see it, just keep it outside

105
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,320
# 有点焦焦的小边
outside a bit burnt

106
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
# 但是还不能说是脆的
but it still can't be crispy.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,400
# 因为它要外焦里嫩这焦是边上的焦
becuase it needs tender with a crispy crust, the crispy crust is the burnt parts on the edge.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,840
# 里边还是嫩的 这就行了
inside is still tender, that's enough

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,280

110
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,720
# 实际上这个连调味都不用调
In fact, we don't even need seasoning

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,760
# 这主要就是腌底口的时候调好了
It is because the flavor is set during the marination.

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,200
# 一次就成了
one-shot

113
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,600
# 这个葱一定要给它爆香
the onion need to be fry till fragrant.

114
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,520
# 这时候香味一出来 来点酱油
after the aroma come out, add some soy sauce

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,880
# 羊肉 翻炒
stir fry the lamb

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
# 小锅翻的
Look his techniques!

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,120
# 孜然粒 撒进去
Add the cumin seeds

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,040
# 您爱吃孜然咱就多来一点
If you like cumin, you can add more

119
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,120
# 一定要让它粒粒都粘上孜然

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
# 还可以撒点芝麻

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,840
# 辣椒面 喜欢吃辣的你也可以多来

122
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,480

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,680
# 这个香菜梗 这是点睛之笔
the cilantro stems, this is the key

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,160
# 叫什么神笔马良 画龙点睛之笔
which is called the finishing touch

125
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,360
# 一定要让它孜然粒匀匀的粘在肉上
must let the seeds evenly attached on the cubes

126
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,560
# 看着就香 闻着就香
looks nice, smell also nice

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,480
# 二伯先吃 我拍您
Er Bai you eat first, i take shot of you

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,680
# 肯定是先给大爷吃 您离我远点
Surely, Da Ye need to get the first bite. Please stand a bit away

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,120
# 您先吃师父 奖励奖励
Master you eat first. It is the reward.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,480
# 我刚才偷着吃半天了
i have secretly eaten a long time.

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800

132
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
# 我来一武吃的你看着大爷
i just grab it

133
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,360
# 这个口感跟片儿绝对截然不同
this texture is truly different from the sliced style

134
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
# 而且它的配料简单
and the ingredients are simple

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,840
# 而且它搭配的四种料的搭配最强
the four condiments' combination is the best

136
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,200
# 现在最关键是什么
now what's the key

137
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,960
# 是这孜然粒你嚼到嘴里边咯吱咯吱香
it's the aroma in your mouth, when you chewing the cumin. 

138
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,520
# 一定要吃这个孜然粒的香
the aroma of the cumin seed is the key.

139
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,280
# 腌料足 姜汁打的好 去膻
The marinade is great, the ginger juice is good. It gets rid of the gamy flavor.

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,080
# 这味儿一次性加足
Add enough flavoring in one-shot.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,760
# 还有一个重要的在哪
