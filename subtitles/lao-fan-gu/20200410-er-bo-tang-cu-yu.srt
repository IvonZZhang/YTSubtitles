# Introduction
# Hello friends. Er Bai will show you how to make a banquet dish today - sweet and sour fish!
# After learning this dish, you will be easily titled the best chef in any family dinners!
# To make a great demonstration, Er Bai has revealed all the secret techniques in this video. You may need to watch carefully and take some notes!
# Unfortunately, the wok is a bit too small, please remember to choose a fish of the right size when making it at home.
# Since the shape of Er Bai's fish is not quite ideal, it is better to hold the fish upside down in the air while frying the fish.
# However, it tastes great. With the passion fruit, grapefruit and Laozao rice wine, the sweet and sour fish has a more complex flavor and texture.
# If there are any other dishes you want to know how to make, please leave your comment in the comment area!

# 刀工一致 起来了是吧
The cuts are even and uniform

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,720

# 吃这条鱼真是不白活一回

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,880
# 葱末 咱再切点姜
Green onion mince. We also need some ginger

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,920
# 没蒜糖醋就不提味
Garlic improves the flavor of the sweet sour sauce

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,800
# 好啦 小料切好啦
Done with cutting

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
# 我们这时候就手把汁儿就调出来了
Let’s make some sauce

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
# 其实为什么搁点盐
Why do we need salt?

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,320
# 这糖醋鱼你看还没少搁吧
See how much sugar we put in the sauce

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,800
# 它必须得搁
It is necessary

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,240
# 师父跟我们讲盐是定味的
Master told us the salt provides the base flavor

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,680
# 米醋 量很大 一勺多点了
Rice vinegar, a large amount, more than 1 big spoon

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,080
# 糖 搁进去
Sugar in

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,160
# 够吗师父 不够再来点
Is that enough? We could add more if not

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,320
# 糖醋糖醋 糖在第一
Sweet and sour flavor, sugar needs to be the main flavor

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,400
# 为什么好多人做这鱼不好吃
This is why some people cannot make this dish well:

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
# 做糖醋的东西
When you make the sweet and sour flavor

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,920
# 你一定要大糖大醋
You need a lot of sugar and vinegar

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,240
# 怕糖尿病人吃不了
You are concerned diabetics cannot eat this?

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,360
# 糖尿病人他都不吃这个
Diabetics will not eat this

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
# 吃这个的人他就要求
But people who want it require that

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,480
# 味道一定要达到味道标准
The flavor must meet the standard

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,160
# 哪家也不能天天吃糖醋
People will not eat sweet and sour dishes everyday

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,760
# 咱们拿一点酱油 调点颜色
We need some soy sauce to add some color

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,200
# 这颜色还浅点
The color is a bit light

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
# 你看这回咱把葱姜米都搁进去
Now we put the minced ginger and spring onion in

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,480
# 要老抽吗师父 来点
Do we need dark soy sauce, Master? Put some

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,760
# 让味道释放出来是吧
We need the amora to be released

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,320
# 颜色还稍微浅一点 再来点（老抽）
The color is still too light. More (dark soy sauce)

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,120
# 然后我们用点开水 激一下
Now we need some boiling water

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,360
# 这鱼改改刀吧  这边烧着开水
While the water is boiling, let’s cut the fish

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,040
# 你要是我们清蒸鱼 干烧鱼
If you are making steamed or dry-braised fish

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,160
# 这都剌个燕尾 这都得去掉
We need to shape the tail and get rid of these

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,920
# 但是糖醋鱼就不能去
For this dish, we don’t need to do that

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,960
# 这就是规矩 这就是讲究
That’s the rule and standard

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,120
# 小魏师父考考你
Xiaowei, let me test you

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,280
# 是直刀下呢还是坡一点
Should you cut straight or with an angle

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,480
# 应该是先直刀后坡刀吧
Should be straight and then with an angle

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
# 里头还得剌一刀
Another cut inside

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,400
# 我感觉师兄这个说法有点靠谱
Sounds right to me

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
# 我赞同
I agree

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,240
# 小魏讲话说的对
Xiaowei is right

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,600
# 就直刀下去 直刀下去 马上就坡
First straight, and then with an angle

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,520
# 坡到最后贴着骨头来一刀
Final cut along the bone

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
# 这么大差不多了有三指
Around 3 fingers distance

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,200

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
# 贴着骨头走
Along the bone

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,400
# 你看见没有 刀工一致 起来了
See? The cuts are uniform

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,840
# 姜给它入了味
Ginger provides some flavor

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,720
# 剩点葱都没事
It’s ok to leave some green onion

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
# 料酒 够么 够
Cooking wine? Is that enough? Enough

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,400
# 去去腥味 然后里边也是
Get rid of the fishy smell. And the inside, too

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,240
# 盐
salt

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
# 腌个二十分钟就足矣
Marinate for 20 min. That should be enough

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
# 这边腌着这边和糊
Now we make some batter

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,880
# 师父汁儿我给调了吧
Master, let me make the sauce

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,360
# 水烧开了 倒里边
Water is boiled, pour inside

68
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,120

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,240
# 先把它攉拢开
Mixed it well

70
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,760
# 来点酱油
some soy sauce

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,280

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
# 这回差不多了
About right

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,040
# 为什么这么调汁不在锅里调啊
Why didn’t we cook the sauce while mixing?

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
# 葱姜煸出来它就煸出味了
Cooking will release the flavor of the green onion and ginger

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
# 它不需要煸味
We don’t want that

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,760
# 它需要在这汁里边
The flavor need to stay in the sauce

77
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,080
# 它吸附这汁把葱姜蒜带出来
Be subtle in the sauce

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
# 它托着这糖醋鱼走
Not the dominating flavor

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
# 你要是稍微一煸
If you cook them

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
# 葱姜味全释放出来了
The flavor becomes too strong

81
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,200
# 那味道就有点别扭
And a bit weird

82
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,280
# 不鲜了是吧 就夺它本身的鲜味
So it covers the taste of fish?

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,840
# 夺糖醋味
It overwhelms the sweet and sour flavor

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,920
# 腌的差不多 二十分钟了
The fish has been marinated for 20 mins

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
# 和糊咱再哪儿和啊
Where should we mix the batter?

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,920
# 找一个盆 开水呢
Find a mixing bowl. Where is the hot water?

87
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,240
# 这是什么粉子师父 玉米粉就行
What is this type of starch? Corn starch

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,920
# 生粉行么 生粉不好
How about potato starch? Not suitable

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,720
# 生粉适合勾芡
Potato starch is better for thickening sauces

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,240
# 玉米淀粉 这就差不多了
Corn starch. Enough

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,120
# 这个水开了么 开了倒这里面
Is the water boiled? Pour in the bowl

92
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,760
# 跟我们做的有点不一样啊师父
It’s a bit different from how we make the batter, master

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,040
# 没见过这种糊啊师父
I didn’t see this type of batter

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,760
# 一会你就明白了
You will understand

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,880
# 一般的都全是这种生糊
Usually you mix them all with cold water

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,800
# 这是生粉还是玉米淀粉
Is this potato or corn starch?

97
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,240
# 玉米淀粉 都是一样的东西
Corn starch. No difference

98
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
# 其实这就是关键是吧
So that is the key

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,760
# 生熟糊 这就是亮点
Shengshu batter (Mixing with cold and hot water, and combine them together). it is special

100
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,720
# 这样吃完了以后
When you eat

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,440
# 脆皮糊有层次感了 层次感就出来了
It provides texture of the coating

102
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
# 这种技法是传统的技法吗
Is it a traditional technique?

103
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
# 这都是过去老师傅
That’s what the chefs in the past did

104
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
# 人家看家的东西人不愿意传
It was their secret, they didn’t want to share it

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,520
# 再来点水
More water

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,400
# 其实这种精华的东西
That’s the essence

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,360
# 博大精深 它有它的道理
It has a lot of science behind it and is very reasonable.

108
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
# 刚才是什么样
Do you remember what it looks like previously

109
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
# 刚才你看它拿不起来
It didn’t easily stick to your hand

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
# 现在就非常听话
But now it can

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,360
# 其实好多人都不知道这个
Not many people know this

112
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
# 解密呢您是解密呢
You are sharing the secret

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360

114
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,080
# 再来点油 好 差不多了
Some oil. That’s enough

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,720
# 差不多吧 差不多
How about that? About right

116
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
# 你看坐上油咱们可以
See? It's good

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,720
# 先让油预热
Heating the oil

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,240
# 你看这个糊多听话  让它自然流下来
See this batter is good, it will flow

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,400
# 里边没挂上
Need some batter inside

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
# 孙勇你要是用这糊的话
Sun Yong, how would you make the batter?

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
# 你应该怎么做啊
What should you do?

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,120
# 弄熟面（淀粉）弄开水烫面（淀粉）
Use boiling water to make the batter

123
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,320
# 说实话我从来没用过
Frankly, I haven’t done it before

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,960
# 差不多了吧 差不多了
It that about right? About right

125
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,160

126
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,680
# 放锅里了 这糊真棒
Put it in the pot. The batter is great

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
# 这条鱼有点大师父
The fish is too big

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
# 提醒网友 在家里买鱼的时候
Friends, if you make this dish at home

129
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,840
# 一定要买小点
Get a smaller fish

130
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,800
# 今天这鱼是二斤半左右
This fish is around 2.5 jin (= 1250g)

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
# 我觉得家里有一斤八两就合适
For home cooking, I think 1.8 jin is enough (= 900g)

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160

133
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,200
# 捞出来油温高了再升一下
Take the fish out, increase the temperature

134
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,480

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,040
# 这边可以 这边你托了底下了
This side is right, that side stuck in the bottom

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,000
# 鱼应该是提溜着这么炸
You should hold the fish while frying

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,320
# 不能（躺着）搁锅里炸
You cannot put it in the wok

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
# 搁锅里炸就不对了
It is not right

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
# 但这糊真棒
But the batter is great

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,920
# 那天梅师哥还说呢

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,600
# 师父做那个鸡丁 用生熟糊

142
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,760

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,760
# 那种酥度那种口感完全不一样
The texture and crispness are totally different

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,920

145
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,840
# 这形状还行 这是第二遍了
The shape looks good. Two times already

146
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
# 炸几遍啊咱这个
How many times do we need to fry it?

147
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,160
# 提油温再炸一遍就齐了
Increase the temperature and fry for the last time

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,080
# 一般是三遍
Usually three times

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,920
# 这尾巴都粘上了 这锅太小
The tail is stuck together. The wok is too small

150
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,120
# 鱼有点大
The fish is too big

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
# 师父这油温够高了吧 这油温够高了
Is the temperature right for frying? Good enough

152
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
# 再复炸一下
One more time

153
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,840
# 你看看  已经特别酥脆了
Look, it is already very crispy

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,920
# 听这声 嘎巴嘎巴的
The sound, Gaba-Gaba (mimic the crispy sound)

156
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
# 吃到嘴里也是嘎巴嘎巴的是吧师父
When you eat, it sounds like Gaba-Gaba

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
# 你看永远都不皮
It will not be soggy

158
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,640
# 成型了 炸了三遍网友们
The shape is settled. We fried it three times

159
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,560
# 搁盘儿里头 漂亮
Put it on the plate, very pretty

160
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,640
# 下一步该炒汁了 这是关键
Next step: making the sauce. It is important

161
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,000
# 你看还有一老传统
See, another traditional technique

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,360
# 湿毛巾轻轻的蘸一下
Wet kitchen towel, cover it for a bit

163
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,480
# 你听听 咔吧咔吧的
Hear, Gaba-Gaba

164
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,160
# 咔吧咔吧脆 让它好入味
Gaba-Gaba crispy, that makes it easier for flavor penetration

165
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,600
# 油温必须得够网友们
The temperature should be high enough

166
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,160
# 你看炸这鱼
See this fish

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,720
# 这糊 嘎巴嘎巴脆 这糊真是好
This batter is Gaba-gaba Crispy. The batter is so good

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
# 但是在我这基础上
Based on my ratio

169
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,560
# 你们应该少搁糊（熟糊）
You guys should put less of the Shu hu (the batter made with boiling water)

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
# 熟糊有点多了 我就给你们做一模板
The Shu hu is a bit too much. I am just showing you an example

171
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
# 咱有百分之十就够
10% should be enough

172
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,040
# 我加了百分之二十
I put 20%

173
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,120
# 所以这东西就有点厚了
So the batter is a bit too thick

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,040
# 最后觉得还是真诚的告诉网友吧
In the end, I have to be honest

175
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,840
# 百分之十合适
10% is right

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,560
# 什么都有比例是吧
We need to follow the ratio

177
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,880
# 油温行啦 不行不行
The temperature is good? Not hot enough

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,360
# 一定要冒烟 冒大烟 冒青烟

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,560
# 得油温特别够 得够一下烹起来

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,200

# 您那醪糟还没搁呢师父
