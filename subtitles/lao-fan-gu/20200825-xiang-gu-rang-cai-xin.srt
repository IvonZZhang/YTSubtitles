# Hi friends, Da Ye hasn’t been making state banquet dishes for a long time. He is going to make one this Friday by taking a challenge to make a state banquet dish for only 50 yuan!

# Shiitake mushrooms and choy sum stuffed with minced shrimp is a dish that has mushroom aroma, bouncy and delicious shrimps, as well as crisp and refreshing choy sum. It has a strong aroma and a well-layered flavour!

# The ingredients are very simple. But with diligent preparation, these simple ingredients can be turned into a dish that could be presented in front of the world as a show case of Chinese culinary tradition!

# At the end of the video, Da ye has also answered a question from many of our viewers, “Whether cooking oil can be used for multiple types? How many times can it be reused?”, if Da Ye has cleared your cloud of confusion, don’t forget to give a ‘like’ to this video!

305
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
# 这鱼就黑了
while frying,

306
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,280
# 这说明这油就不行了
this means the oil cannot be used anymore.

307
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
# 只要它不变色
As long as the colour doesn’t change,

308
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
# 我们再添点新油
We can add some fresh oil to it,

309
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
# 就一点问题没有
This would have no problem at all.

310
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,680
# 但是比如我们要炸个素丸子
But, if we want to fry vegetarian meatballs,

311
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,840
# 炸个油饼
Or a youbing (deep-fried cake,

312
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,080
# 是吧
right,

313
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,680
# 炸的油
the oil needed for that

314
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
# 这油就比较多
is quite a lot.

315
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,960
# 这油多了怎么办呢
So what can we do if there’s a lot of oil？

316
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,560
# 因为它炸的全是素的
Because everything that has been fried in these oil are vegetarian,

317
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,680
# 我们在炒菜当中
(the oil can be reused) when we are making stir-fried dishe.

318
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,960
# 炒一些肉菜
Like stir frying a meat dish,

319
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,760
# 或者烧个鱼或者做什么
or cooking a fish

320
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,120
# 我们添加点油
We could reuse some that oil.

321
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,800
# 因为它是炸过菜的油
Because the oil has been used to fry vegetables,

322
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,480
# 它香
it is very aromatic.

323
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,840
# 逐渐的带着就用进去了
We can use it as we cook.

324
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,720
# 另外我们还可以
We could also use,

325
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
# 比如有那种
For example,

326
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
# 棉纸
paper towers

327
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,320
# 是吧
right,

328
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,680
# 给它过滤一下
to have the oil filtered.

329
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,280
# 它的颜色也会会好一点
The colour of the oil will be better.

330
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
# 这个
In this way,

331
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,240
# 也是用五六次就可以了
the oil could also be used for five to six times.
