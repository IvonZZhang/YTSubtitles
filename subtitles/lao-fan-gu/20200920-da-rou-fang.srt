# Hey friends! Today Er Bai is teaching us to make the modified version of Da Rou Fang (braised pork cube). Meat lovers have to try this!
# 这道大肉方做法简单，不用放一滴水也不用炒糖色，而是用香料烧出的一种独特味道，喷香！一口吃下去软烂多汁、肥而不腻、香味浓郁，实在是太满足了！
# This dish is easy to make. It does not need water and caramelized sugar, but has a unique flavour from braising with  different spices. So aromatic! The meat is tender, juicy, rich and fatty, but not too greasy. The dish is fragrant and very satisfying!

# 1，肉方焯水，锅中放入大葱叶和黄酒去腥，肉方上扎上小孔促进血水流出;
# 1. Parboil the meat with leafy parts of the spring onion and huangjiu rice wine to remove the unpleasant taste. Poke some holes on the top of the meat to help release the blood in it.
# 2.沙姜轻拍，桂皮大料香叶用水清洗，锅中热油放入葱姜和香料干煸出香后，放入拍好的小干葱和沙姜煸炒，下入黄酒增香，酱油上色，下入冰糖和啤酒转小火。
# 2. Crush some sand ginger lightly, then rinse cinnamon, star anise and bay leaves with water. Stir fry onions, ginger and spices with hot oil until aromatic, then add crushed sand ginger and shallot. Pour some huangjiu rice wine for its aroma and some soy sauce for colouring. Add some white rock sugar and beer, then turn the heat down.

# 3，将汤放入高压锅中，肉方捞出擦干水份，肉皮上扎上小孔并抹上蜂蜜，肉皮一侧朝下放入锅中煎制，中间翻面，两面呈现一定焦褐后出锅放入水中清理，用钢丝球去掉一些焦化部位后转移到案板上，皮朝上改刀，模竖各三刀，深度为肉厚度的一半。
# 3. Pour the soup into a pressure cooker, wipe off the excess water on the meat and poke some holes on the pork skin. Then add some honey and pan fry the meat with the skin side down. Flip it over in the middle and rinse it in some water when both sides are dark brown. Remove the burnt bits with steel wool and put it onto a cutting board. With the skin side facing upwards, cut the meat three times both horizontally and vertically to half of its depth .
# 3，肉放入高压锅压25分钟后捞出，锅中汤汁过滤。砂锅中倒油，放入干葱，沙姜，蒜子煸香，下入小香葱和肉方，肉方要皮朝上，倒入过滤好的汤汁盖盖焖至汤汁收干。
# 4. Cook the meat in the pressure cooker for 25 min, then filter the soup. Add some oil into a clay pot, fry some shallot, sand ginger and garlic until aromatic, add scallion and the meat cube with the pork skin facing upwards. Lastly, pour the filtered soup into the pot and braise it with the lid on until the soup has thickened up.

Pour in a bit of Baijiu (strong Chinese liquor).

132
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
# 然后在这盆里头
Then you want to cover the pot

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
# 拿盖
with a lid,

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
# 或者拿保鲜膜绷上
or you can use plastic wrap.

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
# 要让他发酵
Let it ferment

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
# 发酵过程中放那不管了
You don’t have to do much while the fermentation process is going on.

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,400
# 第二天呢
The second day.

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,240
# 还要拿干净的勺子或者筷子
You need to stir it up

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,760
# 要把它搅拌一下
With clean spoons or chopsticks.

140
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,640
# 但是不能放在铝盆里头
Make sure that you are not using a aluminum container.

141
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
# 一定要放一个瓷盆
Use a porcelain pot.

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,520
# 搪瓷盆
Enamel pot.

143
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,680
# 或者我们那种陶瓷盆
Or the traditional ceramic pot.

144
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,480
# 搅完拌以后再给它封上
Cover it again after stirring.

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,880
# 放了一个阴凉地发酵十五天
Store the container in a cool, dry place for 15 days.

146
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,880
# 这不是一次就能成的
It is not enough to stir it only once.

147
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,560
# 对前边要有四五次的搅拌
Yeah, you need to stir the content four or five times during the early fermentation stage.

148
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
# 等到15天以后
After 15 days.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
# 把它拌好了
Stir it up throughly.

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,320
# 我们选几个干净的瓶子
Pick up several clean bottles.

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
# 拿开水烫一下
Sanitize with hot water.

152
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,480
# 或蒸一下消毒
Or steam them before use.

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
# 然后把韭菜花灌进去
Then we can pour in the pickled chives flowers.

154
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
# 拧紧了盖
Cap it tightly

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,080
# 然后放到冰箱里头
with cap on tight.

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
# 你吃就不会坏了
It won’t go bad this way.

157
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
# 咸菜呢也会出现这个问题
The making of pickled cabbage shares the same problem.

158
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
# 比如这咸菜我们如果说
For instance, in the case of pickled cabbages,

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,320
# 不给他搅拌
If we don’t stir it up,

160
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,560
# 那咸菜汤上面会漂一层白膜
There will be a thin white film on the surface of the liquid.

161
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
# 但是它不是汤坏了了
It’s not because fungi grow in the soup.

162
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
# 就因为你在腌的时候
Instead, the white film shows that

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,400
# 它咸味和不咸的地方
during the fermentation process

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,280
# 它不均匀
the salt is not distributed evenly in the solution.

165
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,800
# 那起了白膜怎么办
What if we already have the white film?

166
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,080
# 那这缸子菜不能够扔了啊
Just don’t throw the pot out of your window,

167
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
# 很贵的也是
Picked stuff ain’t no cheap.

168
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,200
# 我们可以适当加点酒
We can add a little bit of liquor.

169
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
# 加一点红糖
Add in some brown sugar.

170
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,640
# 这白膜给它搅拌均匀以后
Stir up until the layer of white film is evenly mixed into the liquid.

171
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
# 这白膜第二天就下去了
The film should disappear the second day.

172
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,240
# 是吧
Yes!

173
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,520
# 还有一种办法呢
There’s another way around this.

174
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
# 实在不行
Last resort:

175
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,880
# 我们就把咸菜全部都捞出来
We can fish out all the pickled veges

176
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,880
# 把这咸菜汤给熬一下
and proceed to boil the liquid content

177
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,080
# 这个腌咸菜的水被污染了
The liquid is contaminated.

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,000
# 所以我们在拿咸菜的时候
So make sure that you wash your hands

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,320
# 手一定要干净
before handling the pickled veges.

180
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
# 不能蘸生水
Don’t get tap water on your hands.

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,600
# 最好有单独的筷子和勺子
It would be better to just use a separate set of chopsticks and spoons.

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,420
# 是吧
Right.

183
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
# 来取这咸菜
When taking out those pickled veges,

184
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
# 一旦腌咸菜的缸里边
If tap water manages to somehow

185
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
# 进了生水了
slide into the pot

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
# 洗菜没有控干的这些菜
Or you did not drain the veges after washing them

187
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,120
# 腌咸菜这汤 泡菜这汤
The liquid content in the pot

188
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,280
# 就特别容易坏
is likely to go bad.

189
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
# 关于韭菜花这块还有什么补充的吗
What else would you add for pickled Leek flowers?

190
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,360
# 没有
Nope

191
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
# 就是说你拿韭菜花
What you really should do is to take the making of pickled leek flowers

192
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,040
# 当做腌菜的一个案例
as a template for any pickled veges.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,560
# 你比如我腌点黄瓜
For example, let’s say we are making pickled cucumbers,

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
# 腌点萝卜
pickled radish...

195
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
# 你看腌萝卜的时候
When processing radish,

196
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,480
# 洗干净以后
After washing it.

197
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
# 刮完皮或者不刮皮
Peeling the skin off or not.

198
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
# 我们把萝卜切成条
We cut radish into strips,

199
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,040
# 先用盐杀水
Sanitize the water with salt.

200
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
# 因为萝卜是先洗了
Because we wash the radish in the first step,

201
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
# 洗完以后
After washing it,

202
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
# 萝卜含的水气太大
The radish is probably soaked with water.

203
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,360
# 所以我们要先杀水
That’s the reason behind sanitizing the water with salt.

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
# 包括黄瓜
Also, in the case of cucumbers,

205
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,880
# 凡是含水量大的这些蔬菜
For veges with high water content,

206
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
# 都要用盐
We always want to use salt.

207
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,600
# 提前用盐把它杀水
use salt to cure it and remove excess water.

208
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,920
# 杀完水以后
After curing it,

209
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
# 我们控干了这水
We drain the water,

210
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,040
# 然后再入缸里头
then put the vegetables into the pot.

211
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,320
# 这样的萝卜腌出来
Only following these specific steps will the radish...

212
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,600
# 才会脆
have the desired crunchy texture to it.

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,260
# 明白
Got it!
