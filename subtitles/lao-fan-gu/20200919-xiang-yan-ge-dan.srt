# 配料：面包片、虾仁、猪肥膘、老核桃仁、淀粉、葱姜酒水、鹌鹑蛋（鸽子蛋太贵）、盐、玉米淀粉、白胡椒粉、蛋清；
# Ingredients: slices of bread, shrimp, fat pork, old walnut kernel, starch, water mixing of green onion, ginger and cooking wine, quail eggs (pigeon eggs are too expensive), salt, corn starch, white pepper, egg white;
# 做法：
# 1.面包片去边后片成薄片然后切成菱形；
# 2.虾仁用厨房纸吸干水份后，刀背拍细然后剁成虾蓉；
# 3.猪肥膘先切薄片，先用刀刃剁然后用刀背砸到起毛（500g虾仁配100g猪肥膘）；
# 4.核桃仁用开水浸泡；
# 5.在一个大的容器中，放入虾蓉和猪肥膘，依次放入葱姜酒水、盐、玉米淀粉、白胡椒粉、蛋清，然后将馅摔打上劲
# 6.去掉桃仁表皮，以半个桃仁为一个单位，然后小火慢炸至轻微上色后捞出，裹上适量淀粉；
# 7.熟鹌鹑蛋剥壳，对半切；
# 7.面包上拍上适量玉米淀粉，防止馅和面包片分离，然后将馅料团成小团放在面包片中心，放上半个鹌鹑蛋，慢慢往面包片上抹馅料，馅料一定要包住鸽子蛋周围。在鸽子蛋两边，面包片长对角线位置放上事先炸好的核桃仁充当大象的眉毛眼儿，外侧在粘上香菜叶；
# 8.油温五成热，肉一侧朝下下锅，面包片成金黄色即可出锅！
# Recipe:
# 1.	Cut out the frame of the bread slices and then cut into thin rhombus.
# 2.	Use the kitchen paper to soak up the water in the shrimp, and then use the knife back to pat the shrimp into paste.
# 3.	Cut the fat pork into thin slices, firstly use the knife to cut it, and then use the back of knife to pat it until it fluffs (500g shrimp with 100g fat pork).
# 4.	Soak the walnut kernel in boiling water.
# 5.	Put the shrimp paste and fat pork in a large container, add water mixing of green onion, ginger and cooking wine, salt, corn starch, white pepper, and egg white, and then temper it to make it cohesive.
# 6.	Peel the walnut kernel and cut into halves, fry them with soft fire until they are slightly colored, and wrap them with starch.
# 7.	Wrap the bread rhombuses with corn starch so that the fillings won’t separate with the bread. Put the filling in the center of each bread, then put half of quail egg, and make sure the filling is around the quail egg. On each side of the quail egg, put the fried walnut kernel as the elephant’s eyebrow and add a cilantro.
# 8.	When the oil reaches 150 centigrade, put the products into the pot with the filling side towards the pot, and when the bread is colored yellow, it is done!

# 过去的老菜 它确实你得继承
You have to inherit the old dish.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
# 为什么说要继承传统文化啊
That’s why we talk about inheriting the traditional culture.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,560
# 菱形 象眼么

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,320

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,920
# 切下来的面包 切成粒儿
Cut the bread frame into small pieces,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,680
# 面包鱼排 鸡排 虾排 肉排都可以

# 一点不浪费
so that you don’t waste it.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,880
# 大爷您这肯定这个菜没少做啊
Da Ye, you must had made this dish very often.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,120
# 那阵是这样
True, in the old days.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,440
# 比如这道菜一卖就卖一星期
For example, this dish was sold for a week,

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,280
# 熟悉下来以后 会干了要精干
after you get familiar with the process, you need to refine your skill,

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,400
# 精干了还要快干巧干 这是一功夫菜
and after you refine your skill, you still need to find ways to make it quickly and effortlessly, so it is a dish that needs a lot of efforts.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,160
# 好了 齐了
Alright.

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,840
# 蘸干（虾仁）水分

# 一拍 剁成虾蓉 虾腻子
Pat it to make shrimp paste.

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,920
# 过去由于内地没有大虾 全是小虾
Because in the old days the mainland China only had small shrimps, no big shrimps,

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,360
# 但是小虾你要是炒个虾仁
but if you make a fried small shrimp,

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,080
# 它不算大菜
it is not a big dish,

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,320
# 所以用这虾仁把它做成馅
so we make the shrimp into shrimp paste,

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
# 再给它变成大菜
and then make it into a big dish.

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,760
# 烧点水一会烫烫桃仁
Heat up some water to soak the walnut kernel later.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
# 来点肥膘
Let’s get some fat pork.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
# 肥膘最好的是通脊肉底下那块肥膘
The best fat pork is the fat lining under the tenderloin.

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,000
# 这个肥膘我们要切薄一点的话
If we cut the fat pork thinly,

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,800
# 拿开水一烫 这肥膘吃起来是脆的

# 一斤虾二两肥膘
1 jin (500g) shrimp with 2 liang (300g) fat pork.

It tastes great.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,880
# 刀背砸一砸
Use the back of the knife to pat it.

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,120
# 砸到最好效果是什么 起毛
What is the best result of patting? It fluffs.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,620
# 看这桃仁没有
Look at these walnut kernels,

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,280
# 桃仁有这外皮特别涩 烫一下
the crusts of the walnut kernels taste puckery, let’s soak them with boiling water.

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,160
# 这是老桃仁 必须用老桃仁
These are old walnut kernels, we must use old walnut kernels.

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,520
# 嫩桃仁油性低 它不香
The young walnut kernels contain little oil, so they smell not that good.

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,280
# 来咱们做这虾馅
Let’s make the shrimp filling.

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,920
# 葱姜酒水把它捏一捏 出点味 就够了
Pinch the green onions and ginger so that they have some taste in the wine water, that’s enough.

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,040
# 然后我们搁点盐
Then let’s add some salt,

50

# 蛋清 有半个蛋清

# 这馅儿一打得了 这菜就完成大半了
Let’s temper the filling, and the dish is already mostly finished.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,080
# 看看 上劲了 颤嘟嘟的
Look, it is cohesive.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,400
# 有弹性
# 上劲儿它才成型
It is resilient.
It has to be cohesive to make shapes.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,160
# 咱们现在剥桃仁 以半个为单位
Let’s peel the walnut kernels in the unit of half of the kernels.

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,960
# 这皮不去掉 它吃起来有点涩苦
If the crusts are not peeled, they will taste a little bitter.

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,400
# 这个在这个菜里边像不像大象的眉毛
Is this seemed like the eyebrows of elephants in this dish?

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,720
# 给点油 炸桃仁 这活就差不多了
Add some oil and fry the walnut kernels, then this dish is almost done.

60
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,280
# 面包上的要搁上点干淀粉 玉米淀粉
Add some starch and corn starch to the bread,

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,320
# 搁这个就为了馅不跟面包分离
so that the filling will not separate with the bread,

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
# 才能锁得住
and the filling is sticked.

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,960
# 再拍拍 瓤馅的东西都要拍粉
Pat it, all the things with fillings must have starch.

64

# 鸽蛋太贵了

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
# （一个鸽蛋）快顶一斤鸡蛋了

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560

The walnut kernels after fried are oily,

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,880
# 少加一点点淀粉或者生粉
a little bit starch or corn starch.

126
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,680
# 然后我们挤肉丸儿
Then let’s make the balls.

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,960
# 它有碱水的这个过程
It has alkali water,

128
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
# 牛肉丸出来以后
so, when the beef ball is made out,

129
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,160
# 它就富有弹性
it will be elastic.

130
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,680
# 加碱水就能富有弹性
Adding some alkali water will make it elastic

131
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
# 大概加多少
Approximately how much should we add?

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,000
# 二斤肉丸吧
2 jin (1000g) beef balls,

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,960
# 比如说5克或者3克
for example, 5g or 3g.

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,120
# 第一你可以试
Firstly, you can try.

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,120
# 比如我先搁3克
For example, I firstly add 3g,

136
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
# 你看打完了
after the beef balls are made,

137
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
# 挤出一个丸子搁这水
put one in the water,

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,080
# 汆熟的时候你看效果
fully cook it to see the result.

139
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
# 不够弹力
If it is not elastic enough,

140
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,960
# 还要再加上2克
add 2g more.

141
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,080
# 可以现加是吧
So we can add the alkali water then?

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,120
# 但是现加以后
But after adding the alkali water,

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,960
# 一定要给它一定的时间
you must give it some time,

144
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
# 比如还有可能还要加一点点的小苏打
for example, it is possible that it still needs a little baking soda,

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
# 使它能嫩
so that it is soft and tender.

146
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
# 明白
Got it.

147
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,080
# 敲牛肉的时候要敲多长时间
How long should we beat the beef?

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,320
# 应该说要敲到两个小时左右
Approximately two hours

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,040
# 不是说像我们买的肉馅
It is impossible that the chopped beef that we buy

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,520
# 就能打成那样肉丸那是不可能的
can be made into beef balls.

151
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,320
# 敲的时候要着实的敲
When beating the beef, you must beat it powerfully.

152
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
# 别用这棒子尖
Don’t use the sharp side of the stick,

153
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,880
# 老是砸一坑不行
it is not ok to beat a pit.

154
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
# 千万不能用机器
Don’t use machines.

155
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
# 就完全要靠手工打
You must handmake it.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,680
# 明白
Got you.

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,960
# 所以这是很要功夫的
So it needs a lot of efforts.

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
# 所以说总结技巧的话就是两点
So I conclude two skills.

159
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
# 一是功夫
One is effort,

160
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,920
# 就是要敲打两个小时
Which means you must beat it two hours,

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,240
# 对吧
right?

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,720
# 匀速
In a constant speed.

163
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
# 然后像刚才您说那个技巧
And like the skill you said

164
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
# 另外一个就是加碱水
The other skill is to add some alkali water,

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
# 加以适当的加一点碱水不要多
add a little bit alkali water, don’t add too much.

166
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
# 那个碱水是什么呢
What is that alkali water?

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,280
# 这点呢要讲一个我们传统的工艺
Here we need to talk about one of our traditional technique.

168
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
# 比如过去我们做水晶虾
For example, in the past we made crystal shrimp.

169
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,600
# 由于过去在70年代
Because in the 70s,

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
# 物产不发达
products are not very abundant,

171
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,400
# 很多大虾都在一个冷库里边
many big shrimps are in a refrigeration storage,

172
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,040
# 而且不是超低温冷库
and were not even ultralow refrigerator,

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,920
# 基本上都是零下6度最低的也就12度
mostly -6 centigrade, the lowest was -12 centigrade.

174
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,120
# 虾由于长时间的保存
The shrimps were not very fresh

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
# 这虾就不是很新鲜了
because of longtime storage,

176
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
# 但是我们这虾还要用
but we still needed to use the shrimps,

177
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,240
# 有的还变色了
some of the shrimps even changed color,

178
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,400
# 变成红色了
turned into red.

179
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,680
# 像这种虾可能要炒着吃
The shrimps like that sometimes were going to be fried,

180
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,440
# 做馅都不行了
but not for making fillings.

181
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
# 所以我们在腌制这虾的时候
So, when we cured the shrimps,

182
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,800
# 要搁点食用碱
we needed to add some dietary alkali

183
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
# 拿它一下
to cure it.

184
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,360
# 等拿完了以后
After curing,

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
# 再把这碱水再给它冲出去
the alkali water needed to be washed out.

186
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,920
# 你再看这虾
Then you looked at the shrimp,

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
# 那虾就透明的
it became transparent.

188
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,640
# 当然说我们还有好多工业上的
Of course, we have a lot of industrial,

189
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
# 食品工业当中的一些添加剂
additive in food industry.

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,200
# 因为咱们在民间的生活当中
Because in our daily life,

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
# 我们很少用
we seldom use,

192
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
# 基本就用一点碱水
basically only use a little bit alkali water.

193
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,560
# 还有像南方的广东那边
And like Guangdong Province in the south,

194
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,440

Alkali water for cuisine,

196

# 这个是可以用的
and that is good to use.

197

# 就做这种手打牛肉丸
For making the handmade beef balls,

198
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
# 最好是选择什么牛的什么部位
What part of beef should we choose?

199
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,760
# 牛肉丸 一般就是用后腿
Beef balls usually are made of round flank,

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
# 就纯瘦肉
pure thin beef.

201
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
# 我们打完了以后
After we make it,

202
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
# 拿水汆得了
fully cook it with boiling water,

203
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
# 往地下一扔
and throw it on the floor,

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,520
# 能蹦起一米高以上
it can bounce to 1m or higher.

205
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
# 您做过
You have made it?

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,360
# 我曾经打过
Yes, I had.

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
# 因为我们原来碰到这些学校
Because the schools we met

208
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,120

said the beef balls were not crispy,

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,640
# 很简单
it is actually very simple,

210
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,600
# 就是搁点碱
just to add some alkali.

211
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,440
# 以前因为我们不注重食品安全
In the past we didn’t care much about food safety,

212
