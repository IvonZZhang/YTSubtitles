# 以前都是拌水啊师父

# 过去讲二合油炒菜香啊

# 这就行了 温度行了

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,360
# 一下（下多了）就糊了 这可以慢慢加
Add the oil one-off, it'll be burnt. We can do it slowly

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,280
# 这样油热点 它糊不了
So that it doesn't get burnt even if the oil is too hot

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
# 一次次加热

# 就让网友学这个他有把握

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,680
# 油耗完了 现在调汁 我煮面
I've used up the oil. Now prepare the sauce and boil some noodles

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,720
# 这个东西很简单
This is really simple

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,080
# 小葱花 不能切成葱末
Cut the scallion in this way. Don't mince it

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,000
# 这个芽菜可以搁点 让它香
Add some 'Ya Cai' (Sichuan preserved mustard green) to make it aromatic

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,400
# 味精其实对人体没有害 沏出来没问题
MSG is acutally not harmful to our health, at least in this way

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
# 因为这个温度不够 它到不了八十五度
Since the temperature is not high enough. It hasn't reached 85 degrees Celcius

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,920
# 可以搁点猪油 提提香
We can add some lard to enhance the aroma

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,600
# 要没有也没关系
It's ok if you don't have it

56

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,160
# 然后还有一样重要的东西 这个师父
One other important thing. This one, master

58
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,360
# 灵魂 灵魂就是红油

# 说话有水平啊
That's the right way to say it

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
# 要的 煮面喽
Okay! Boil the noodles

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
# 这个就是普通的切面 细切面
These are just normal noodles. Thin cut noodles

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,360
# 过去是用好鸡汤
In the past we used decent chicken broth

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,040
# 我们今天不用鸡汤
Today we don't use chicken broth

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
# 我们就用这原汤 也一样
Use the noodle water here. It's equivalent

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,880
# 也还原这味道
It can also reproduce the best taste

67
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,040
# 简单当中它不是我的味道不好
In short, it's not that it tastes bad

68
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,280
# 如果说你要炒了
Instead, if you stir-fry it

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,840
# 这芽菜的味道就会失去了很多
Most of the flavor in 'Ya Cai' will be gone

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,800
# 炒完了这个味道马上就变了
It tastes different immediately after frying

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
# 就不好吃了
and it goes bad

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
# 这个担担面 我可以这么说
This recipe of Dan Dan Noodles, I would say

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,800
# 这个技艺几乎没了 我今天还原给你们

# 熟了 再烫个油菜心
It's done. Boil some choy sum

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,000

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
# 还有一个什么呢
What else?

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
# 冲一下汤 为什么得先冲汤
Add the hot noodle water into the bowl. Why do this first?

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,400
# 必须开锅冲这汤
We must use the hot noodle water to make the 'soup'

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,760
# 如果你要后加 把面条搁上再冲汤
If you are doing it later, say put the noodles on the sauce and add water later

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,320
# 这香气就出不来
The aroma is not going out

83
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,600
# 你看它这东西就这么怪
It is indeed interesting

# 来点汤
Add some soup

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,600
# 这怎么样 够不够小魏 咸味
What do you think? Is it salty enough, Wei?

91
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
# 芽菜的香味儿 辣味
The aroma of 'Ya Cai', the spicy flavor

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
# 包括红油跟面的这种碰撞
And the collision between the red chili oil and noodles

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,560
# 这一站就到四川啦 巴适得很
I feel I'm already in Sichuan. Tastes amazing

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
# 你吃一口尝尝
Take a bite

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,600
# 你干了二十年老面点师了
You've been a pastry chef for 20 years

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
# 师父也不是干面点的
I am not a pastry chef myself

98
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,440
# 再喝口汤
Try the soup?

99
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,080

100
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,680
# 这真挺地道的 真挺好吃的
This is so authentic. Delicious indeed

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,320
# 它吃完了没有麻酱糊嘴的味儿
You don't have the 'sticky' feeling of seasame sauce after eating

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,360
# 这个汤就得烫点 越烫越好
The soup should be hot. The hotter, the better

103

104
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,440

# 以下字幕暂时没有时间轴，请直接审核文字
# 有网友问 说家里的火没有饭店里那么旺
# Some fans say that the cooking stoves in their homes are not as powerful as those in restaurants
# 所以在家炒菜的时候怎么能够控制火候
# and they wonder how to control the temperature when cooking at home
# 有什么技巧
# and if there are some tricks
# 在家里边 火比较弱
# Generally the heaters in home are not powerful enough
# 尽量让它温度稍微高一点
# So you should try to use a slightly higher temperature
# 然后这量呢
# and the amount of food...
# 你如果说在家里边炒菜量要太大
# If you are cooking a lot of food for one dish in your home
# 也不行
# that's not gonna work
# 根本不行
# not at all
# 这量适当的合适
# The amount of food should be moderate
# 你要说够一盘吃的
# Say, if the amount is about one plate
# 那基本就没问题
# Basically it'll be fine
# 所以在炒的这过程当中
# During the cooking process
# 一是我们把油温升高 把锅温升高
# Firstly, enhance the temperatures of the oil and the wok
# 炒菜当中要采取其它一些措施
# Some other measures should be taken while cooking
# 如果说要炒菜 还有一个方法
# If you are stir-frying, there is another trick
# 要把它分类炒开了
# Stir-fry each ingredient separately
# 能用碗汁的 我们兑个碗汁
# For example, if 'bowl-sauce' (prepare all condiments in one bowl in advance) is applicable, you can make one
# 比如说荤料的东西我们先滑了
# Slightly fry the meat before cooking
# 滑好以后捞出来
# Fish the meat out of the oil
# 刷完锅我们再升温炒一些配料
# Rinse the wok, raise the temperature and stir-fry some other ingredients
# 这样把它分段给解开了
# In this way, the dish is separated into several 'sections'
# 分解开了再一块投进去
# Finally, mix every ingredient together in the wok
# 你这样下碗汁之后先别急着扒拉
# Add the 'bowl-sauce', but don't stir the food immediately
# 让它凝固一下
# Let it condense for a while
# 你这样再翻
# And then you can toss the wok
# 相对来讲就解决了这个问题
# Such that this problem can be fixed
# 火的问题就解决了
# the temperature loss problem due to low power heater
# 明白了吧
# You get it?
