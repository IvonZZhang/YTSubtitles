38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,120
# 大家一定要看好时间

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,480
# 不能超过十五分钟 超过十五分钟之后

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
# 十五分钟大家看好时间

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
# 锅里面我们加油炼葱油 花生油
Let's add some oil into the wok to prepare the scallion oil. We use peanut oil here

# 慢慢的熬慢慢的炸就行
Just soak-fry it slowly

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,480
# 火也不用太大 葱的香味完全炸出来
We don't need to use high heat either. The aroma of scallions should be brought out completely

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,120
# 炸这不能急
You shouldn't be impatient while frying this

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
# 炸的有一点点上色了有一点点干了
When the scallion becomes a bit darker and drier

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
# 葱还得要呢
We'll need to use the fried spring onion later

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,160
# 所以这葱切的要漂亮

# 这个放下去慢慢的炸一下
Fry it slowly

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,360
# 大家看一下这个葱稍微有一点发黄
See? When the green onion just turns yellow

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,760
# 然后把这个火关了
Stop heating

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
# 用余温把它沁一下 就可以了
Soak-fry the green onion with the residual heat and it's done

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
# 这样的话保持葱的绿色
In this way, the green color can be preserved

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,760

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,080
# 把它捞出来
Take it out

69
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,320

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,120
# 这个油倒出来
Now pour out the oil

71
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,240
# 这个锅就留油不用洗了
Keep some oil in the wok. You don't need to wash it

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
# 然后就炸干贝丝了
Then we fry the dried scallop

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,360
# 葱油放在旁边备用
Let's put aside the scallion oil

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
# 这面要不好吃的才怪呢
The noodles can't taste bad

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,600
# 花生油 有三两
Peanut oil. That's about 150 grams

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,760
# 油温稍微低一点 慢慢撒下去
Use a low oil temperature. Sprinkle it slowly

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,880
# 大家拿不准的话可以先少放一点点
If you are not sure (about the temperature), add a bit first

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,760
# 慢慢的试 稍微再等一会 慢慢放
Try it slowly. Wait for a while and add some more

79
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,240
# 两成油温 慢慢的撒下去
20% hot (60 degrees Celcius). Sprinkle it slowly

80
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,320
# 干贝炸好了之后放在冰箱里面
When the dried scallop is ready, store it in the fridge

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,840
# 拌小凉菜 拌面的时候放一点点
So that you can use some when making a cold dish or cooking noodles

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,360
# 这个干贝把它搓碎了之后
When the dried scallop is rubbed into pieces

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,880
# 不要一起下得慢慢的下
Don't add it altogether. Add it slowly

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,120
# 一起放下去它容易起坨
It tends to clump up if you add it all together

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
# 不要炸得太干太硬 金黄色
Don't fry it too dry and hard. When it's golden yellow (it's done)

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,000
# 干贝的香味马上出来了
The aroma of the dried scallop is coming out now

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,640
# 这个不需要吸油
Here we don't need to absorb the oil

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
# 葱油拌面本身也需要油 又一份油
-Because you need oil in this dish. -Another portion of oil

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,800
# 然后这个虾把它剥一下就行
The dried shrimp... Simply peel it

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,480
# 剥去虾的外皮  每个细节都很重要
Remove the shrimp shell. Each detail matters

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,960
# 这个不能炸 一定要煎
You shouldn't deep fry the shrimp. Fry it with less oil

92
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,880
# 锅里面少放一点点油
Add a little oil into the wok

93
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,840
# 就是刚刚炸干贝的油
Just the oil that we used for frying the dried scallop

94
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
# 鲜上加鲜 火小一点点
-There's a double savory taste! -Use low heat

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,760
# 煎一分钟就可以了
Fry it for just one minute

96
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,200
# 因为本身干虾可以直接吃
Because the dried shrimp itself is ready to eat

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,760
# 把它两面煎成微微的黄色
Fry both sides into pale yellow

98
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,320
# 把这虾的香味煎出来就可以了
Fry out the aroma of the shrimp

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
# 这干虾家市场能买到么 市场能买到
-Can we find the dried shrimp in the markets? -Yes

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,880
# 没有干贝 没有虾干
If you don't have dried scallop or dried shrimp

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
# 用点海米我觉得也行 也可以
-I think you can use 'Hai mi' (small dried shrimp) instead. -Yes, that also works

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,960
# 拣出来 一会拌面的时候
Take the shrimp out. When we make the noodles later

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
# 把它放上去就可以了
Put the shrimps on the top

104
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
# 得关了火了 你看熬出来了

# 蔬菜的香味完全出来了

106
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,120
# 接下来我们就把酱油箅出来
Then we filter the soy sauce

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,080
# 烧水煮面了 好勒
Now boil the noodles. Ok!

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
# 碱面么 南方用碱面 北方用细面也可以
-Noodles made with soda? -You can buy noodles with soda in southern areas. But if you are in the north, you may use normal thin noodles

109
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,160
# 这个下去煮不能超过两分钟
You shouldn't boil the noodles for over 2 minutes

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,440
# 如果时间煮久了面会坨 没有面的筋道
If too long, the noodles will stick together and lose the chewy texture

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
# 不能超过两分钟 大家一定要注意了
No longer than two minutes! Be careful

112
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,200
# 捞起来一个简单的技巧
There's a simple trick when you take the noodles out

113
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
# 大家看一下 过一下凉

114
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
# 冲凉 沥一下水
Cool down with cold water and drain it

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,080
# 然后放到锅里面一烫
Then heat it shortly again in the pot

116
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,240
# 这样拌面的时候它就一点都不坨
In this way, the noodles won't be sticky at all

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,280
# 把水沥干
Drain the water

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,760
# 二两多面 酱油应该在十几克
That's about 100 grams of noodles, so we add about 10 grams of soy sauce

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080

Depending on your preference

120

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,880
# 再来一点更香一点

124
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,520
