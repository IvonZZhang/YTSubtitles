# 炙子炒面 大爷
Da Ye, we are making the fried noodles on the cast iron plate.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,880

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,280
# 牛肉 牛外脊 顶刀切
Here is our beef short loin and we are slicing it against the grain

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,360
# 这个牛肉给它拍一下
Let’s pound it a bit

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,960
# 更容易入味了
For a better marination

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,600
# 而且它把肉的质地给它拍松了
It also tenderizes the meat

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,240
# 它在传热的时候
It prevents it from shrinking

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
# 它不会（缩）再回不来了
When it hits the heat

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,000
# 所以比较松 大爷说的太对了
So it stays loose (Da Ye is right)

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
# 而且肉质特别嫩
And tender

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,080

# 搁点盐 胡椒粉
Salt and pepper

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,920
# 搁点鲜味汁 这牛肉更加鲜
A bit of umami seasoning to enhance the taste.

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,880
# 再来点蚝油 正好
Some oyster sauce, perfect.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,760
# 多了咸了 入味提鲜
Just enough to bring more umami, if you put too much it will get salty.

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,120
# 它有一定的黏度 包裹在一起
It also provides some stickiness.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,120
# 食用小苏打 两克
A bit of baking soda, about 2 grams

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,600
# 搁苏打起嫩的
It further tenderizes the meat

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,160
# 非常嫩了 如果说再腌上半个小时更嫩
It is already very tender. If you marinate it for another 30 minutes, it will be more tender.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,720
# 先给它上浆 来点香油 抓黏糊了
Give it a good mix with some sesame oil

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,160
# 葱姜酒水 多打点水没事 就这么让它往上抓
Then the garlic-spring onion water. It’s fine to add a bit more while you keep mixing it.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,080
# 抓完了还能吃
The meat can absorb even more water.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,160
# 再来点儿
Let’s add some more.

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,400
# 上了劲儿以后弄上淀粉

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
# 放点玉米淀粉 锁住水分
We are using corn starch to lock the moisture in the meat.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,320
# 再给你封点油
Then we add some oil

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,200

With oil, it will be moist.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,320
# 切点辅料 洋葱别太少了
Chop other ingredients. The amount of onions shouldn't be too little.

00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,360

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,400
# 看这一打直冒烟儿
Look at that “smoke”

45
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,120

# 先别动 一点都没粘

# 炙子 这是关键

# 没铁板用砂锅也行

# 因为番茄沙司是
Ketchup is

120
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,000
# 通过番茄酱进一步的进行调味
basically tomato sauce with some further seasoning.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,960
# 形成一种调味品
It’s a type of seasoning sauce

122
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,840
# 你看我们在 M记 开封菜
See, in McDonalds or KFC

123
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,960
# 吃的薯条 或者一些干炸食品
The french fries, or other deep-fried food

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,320
# 大家蘸上番茄沙司吃 就很有味道
We dip with ketchup, tastes good.

125
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,760
# 但是我们做菜 用的番茄酱
But we usually use tomato sauce for cooking

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,280
# 我们用一般不用番茄沙司
We hardly use ketchup

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,880
# 我不知道他调的味道有什么变化
Because we do not know what extra seasoning is in the sauce.

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
# 所以番茄酱里面是没有味道的
There is no extra seasoning in the tomato sauce

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,960
# 该加盐加盐 该加糖加糖
So we can control the amount of salt, sugar

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,920
# 该加醋加醋
Or vinegar

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,280
# 不管是做大甜酸 小甜酸
When we make the sweet-sour dishes

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,960
# 包括果汁的一些菜肴
Or some dishes with fruits.

133
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
# 特别恰到好处
It is better to use tomato sauce.

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,560
# 所以这个番茄酱和番茄沙司的区别
So, the difference between the two

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,200
# 就是一个调好味了 一个没调好味
One is seasoned, one is not.

136
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,560
# 就自己在调制一些糖醋汁的话
So when you are making some sweet-sour sauce

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
# 或者有一些手法的话
Or some other cooking methods,

138
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,600
# 它适当的少量的加一些番茄酱
You can add some tomato sauce

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,280
# 他为了中和一下这颜色
It adds a bit of the color

140
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,920
# 但又不破坏味道
Without affecting the seasoning

141
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,880
# 后续的味道去自己加去
So that you can control the seasoning yourself.

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,520
# 行 下一个
OK next

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
# 还有
What’s next
