# Lao Fan Gu Exclusive Shiitake Mushroom Beef Paste & Decode Different Types of Vinegar (part 1)

# 简介

# 小友们好！又到周一了，老饭骨又为大家上菜咯！
# Hi dear friends, it is Monday again, Lao Fan Gu are bringing you more dishes!
# 这次带来的是香菇牛肉酱——牛肉颗颗分明、饱满多汁，吸收了香菇的香味。
# Today we want to introduce our exclusive Shiitake Mushroom Beef Paste-flavorful with juicy beef and aroma from Shiitake Mushroom.

# 无论小友们是下饭、下面还是夹馒头，都非常不错！
# 但是做这酱需要耐心慢慢熬制，把里面的水分都熬出去，这样能够保存更久的时间。
# 片尾还有大爷回答小友们的问题：各种醋的区别到底是什么呢？小友们可要记得收看哦！
# It is perfect with rice, noodles as well as Mantou (aka Chinese steamed buns)!
# But please be patient during cooking since dehydrating by slow-cooking is helpful for longer storage.
# At the end of this video, Da Ye is going to answer the question from comments: what is the difference between kinds of vinegar? Please don’t miss it!
