# 川菜的老菜 麻婆豆腐
An old traditional Sichuan dish, MapoTofu

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
# 先把花椒焙一下
First let's toast the Sichuan peppercorn

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,080
# 焙花椒呢 要小火
Keep on low heat when toasting, do it slowly

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,280
# 火不要大 慢慢焙
Keep on low heat when toasting, do it slowly

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,520
# 焙香 焙安逸些
Toast it until fragrant, until "An yi (tasty)"

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,400
# 花椒好了 晾一晾
That's ready, set it aside to cool a bit

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,560
# 这个豆腐呢 把上边这层给它片下去
Slice the top layer from the Tofu

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,600
# 今天这个豆腐 就买的是嫩豆腐
We bought the tender tofu today

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,320
# 这烧的麻婆豆腐才好吃呢 对
That's what makes the MapoTofu tasty (bingo)

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,120
# 兑点开水 稍微加点盐
Some boiling water and a pinch of salt

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,480
# 直接就给它下锅了
...and throw in the Tofu

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,640
# 这个放盐呢 就是要让豆腐通过加热
The salt helps reducing the gaminess

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,560
# 去掉豆腐的豆腥味 让豆腐的蛋白质凝固
and coagulating the protein in the tofu

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,000
# 它就出来以后不容易碎 不要动了
So that the tofu won't break easily. Now leave it, don't stir

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,320
# 像老豆腐 换一遍到两遍水
For aged tofu, you need to blanch it in fresh water twice

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,240
# 因为它那里边有卤水的味道
because there's some briny flavour left in the tofu

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
# 下面呢 备点料
Next some condiments,

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,240
# 郫县豆瓣酱 这是灵魂
PiXian broad bean paste, that's the absolute soul of this dish

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,760
# 这个豆瓣酱 把它剁碎以后呢
It releases all its flavours after it's finely chopped

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
# 味道就全部都出来了
It releases all its flavours after it's finely chopped

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,160
# 这豆豉 干豆豉 洗一洗
This is dried, fermented black bean. Wash it

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,240
# 洗完了我们拿水泡上
... and soak it in water.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,720
# 我这也是 搁一块
Just combine with the bean paste

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
# 这豆豉一定要剁 不剁那香味释放不出来
You have to chop the bean also, or else the fragrance is trapped inside

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
# 为什么要放一块剁呢
But why chopping them together?

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
# 它这个豆豉不容易跑
Because the bean won't run off easily

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
# 它有豆瓣酱揽着它
as it's been trapped by the gooey paster.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
# 好了 花椒凉了啊
Alrighty, the Sichuan peppercorn is cooled

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,400
# 做椒盐儿啊 花椒面啊
You have to toast the peppercorn fresh, when making pepper-salt and ground pepper

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,680
# 都是要现焙 香
You have to toast the peppercorn fresh, when making pepper-salt and ground pepper

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,720
# 花椒还是用多少焙多少 不要太多
You only toast as much as you need

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,680
# 搁时间长了它就没味了 麻味也少了 是
The fragrance will run off if left outside

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
# 你看 大爷这个你看小箩一筛
You see, it's much better after sieving

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,040
# 这就够了 传统工艺
That's it, traditional trick!

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,400
# 豆腐一开锅就闷就行
Just keep the pot warm after water boils

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
# 切点小料
Let's do some condiments

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,800
# 你像二伯做宫保鸡丁
Like the Kung-pao chicken ErBai made,

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,680
# 那切的是大葱花 这叫小葱花
he diced the leek larger, we dice it finer this time

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,680
# 川菜之所以好吃 这个料啊 料重 香
The real reason Sichuan dishes are so good, is they use a lot of aromatics

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,640
# 包括油啊 你看真正做 我们都用什么油啊
including even the choice of oil:

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,680
# 用菜籽油 菜籽油它比较粘稠
we use the oil made from toasted canola, which is more viscous

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,960
# 着原材料 着的比较重
it coats the ingredients better

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,600
# 出来这个菜就特别香
and that's the key to flavour!

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,160
# 青蒜 这些原材料都准备好了
Garlic sprouts, done.

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,920
# 可以开火了
It's ready to roll!

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,320
# 多倒点 花生油 剁好的牛肉末
In with oil, and minced beef

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,200
# 煸香煸透  把豆瓣酱给我 来啦
Fry it until cooked through, and pass me the bean paste!

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,280
# 豆瓣酱一定要煸香 煸酥 煸香煸酥
You have to cook the bean paste thoroughly, cook it until crunchy and fragrant

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
# 下葱姜小料
In with scallion and ginger

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,880
# 早一点放葱姜呢
The reason we add them early on:

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
# 让它一个是降低油的温度
Firstly, it cools down the oil a bit

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,320
# 二呢 让它煸出的更香一些
Secondly, it's more fragrant this way

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
# 这点很关键啊
That's a key point

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,960
# 你看有的快出锅了才搁辣椒面
Some add the ground chili when finishing

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,720
# 那就不对了 一定把这香气给放出来
that's very incorrect. Add it now will let it release its flavour better

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
# 肉一定要煸酥
Again, meet has to be cooked until crunchy

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,560
# 所谓酥呢 就是煸透
basically cook it through.

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,040
# 黄酒 再来点儿酱油
Cooking wine (Shaoxing wine), soy sauce

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
# 老抽 来点水 烧豆腐
Dark soy sauce, water, to stew the tofu

65
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,400
# 放半盆 好嘞 够了吧 好了
Half a bowl of water. - Sure! that's enough? - Just right

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,040
# 豆瓣酱啊不少 咱就不加盐了
Cuz the bean paste is already quite salty, we don't need more salt

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,280
# 略微的加点糖 你闻这味出来了
A bit of sugar though. (you can really smell it now)

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,600
# 再早啊 做麻婆豆腐不搁糖
In earlier times, you don't add sugar making MapoTofu

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
# 做辣菜不要搁胡椒粉
Don't add ground white pepper when making spicy dishes

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,760
# 两个辣合到一起 品尝不出来
you won't be able to taste the difference,

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
# 它那个味就很香了
as it's already spicy and smelling nice

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
# 这是老抽 这味都调好了
This is dark soy sauce, that's it with seasoning

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,600
# 我们把豆腐（放进去）
Now, tofu in

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,000
# 这个时候呢 我们为了让这个味道更加柔
To make the dish taste more balanced and coherent from bottom up,

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,160
# 从上到底 都能吃出这个味道是统一的味道
To make the dish taste more balanced and coherent from bottom up,

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,840
# 这时候把焙好的花椒面
We put in part of the ground Sichuan pepper now

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,640
# 可以提前烧 提前搁里边一部分
Give it some head start

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,680
# 因为我们先吃 先麻啊

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,040
# 最后出锅的时候还要撒
we add the other half when finishing

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,000
# 吃到底下底下没味啊
But that way the numbing flavour won't reach the bottom if we don't add some now

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
# 所以这时候先搁一点 花椒面
But that way the numbing flavour won't reach the bottom if we don't add some now

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
# 使这麻婆豆腐更入味
it blends the flavour much better

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,800
# 先咕嘟一会儿
Leave it braise for a while

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
# 有的为什么 有好多人烧菜不入味
Many people don't braise it long enough until slurring the dish

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,840
# 咕嘟咕嘟一开锅就勾芡了 这时间短
that's why their dishes are bland

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
# 都好了啊 现在咱勾芡
Now it's ready to add slurry

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,320
# 我们上次说的 勾芡不是一次勾芡
Like we said last time, in multiply rounds

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,440
# 逐步的勾芡 要分成一步两步甚至三步
...gradually, up to three times

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
# 中火
Put your fire to medium,

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,560
# 二次勾芡 看着啊 收汁儿
See, the second time, also reducing the sauce

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,880
# 推 推
push it away from you

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
# 这个豆腐呢 还有两种呈现的方式
There basically are two ways this dish is presented:

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
# 一种是汁儿大的
one is wee bit saucy,

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
# 我今天做的就是汁儿大一点儿 宽汁儿的
let's do that today, saucy kind

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,120
# 还有一种是窄汁的 有的是用砂锅上的
another kind is a bit less sauce, presented in a clay pot, or on a dish

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,160
# 有用的盘上的
another kind is a bit less sauce, presented in a clay pot, or on a dish

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
# 这个配碗米饭 米饭都蒸好了
It's best with a bowl of rice,... which just happens to be ready

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,760
# 麻婆豆腐好了 关火 青蒜
Okay it's done. Fire to off, some diced garlic sprouts

99
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,840
# 这也是一样 也是两步 两个步骤
Same with this, two steps

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
# 这就行了 出锅
That's ready now, out goes the MapoTofu

101
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,360
# 我来 帮我装盘啊 我来出盘
Aw, let me handle that, I'll do the plating

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,040
# 抬起抬起
Raise the pan a bit

103
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
# 真地道啊
Wow, look at that good ol' traditional taste

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,200
# 最后那青蒜 画龙点睛
the bit of garlic sprouts, perfect!

105
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
# 然后花椒面
Don't forget the ground Sichuan pepper

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,200
# 因为底下有味了 上面撒均匀
Remember we put some in earlier? Just evenly spread it on top.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,200
# 二伯 这都是VIP待遇
That's VIP service for Erbar there

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,640
# 二伯带点饭啊
Have it with some rice!

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,680
# 好吃 又嫩 真是那七个味都出来了
Damn good that is. Mixing all seven flavours:

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,160
# 麻 辣 烫 鲜 香 酥 嫩
Numbing, spicy, sizzling, umami, fragrant, crunchy and tender.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,040
# 中国菜的灵魂在哪儿 就是融合
That's the spirits of Chinese cooking, coherence and well-balanced

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,360
# 它七个特点融合的非常到位
The flavours were blended so nicely.

113
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
# 真的大爷 这不是表扬你
Not to praise you my man, it's really, really good

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
# 这做的真的好
Not to praise you my man, it's really, really good

115
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,280

116
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
# 有网友请大爷二伯
Some of you asked DaYe and ErBai

117
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
# 讲讲不同类型的醋
what are the different kinds of vinegar in Chinese cooking

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,240
# 地方醋
Regional vinegar,

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,920
# 像山西的地方醋

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
# 像保宁醋做鱼香肉丝
Like you would use the Baoning vinegar to YuXiang pork,

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
# 宫保鸡丁用它那个醋
and for Kung-pao chicken

125
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,360
# 它那个醋一个是颜色也好看

# 再加上味道稳定

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920

128
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,360
# 它挥发的不会那么快
It won't evaporate as fast when heated

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,440
# 香味也很不错
Also, full in flavour.

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
# 镇江香醋也好
Zhengjiang vinegar is also good

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
# 是不是恒顺香醋也好
also is Hengshun vinegar,

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,640
# 山西老陈醋也好
and the aged ones from Shanxi province.

133
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
# 稍微适合颜色重一点这个菜
They are suitable for dishes with heavy coloring,

134
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,440
# 你比如说北京菜
like Beijing dishes using Beijing's rice wine vinegar

135
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,640
# 北京的米醋
like Beijing dishes using Beijing's rice wine vinegar

136
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,480
# 你要做乌鱼蛋汤

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,520
# 味道很好
Although those other vinegars have more fragrance, and taste

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,560
# 但是它味道太重
they are also a bit too overwhelming.

141
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
# 它就不能使这些东西
So they cannot be used in dishes like sweet-sour fish

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,720
# 包括做糖醋鱼
So they cannot be used in dishes like sweet-sour fish

143
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,640

146
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,640
# 你比如说像杭州菜的
For example in Hangzhou dishes (a city near Shanghai)

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,520
# 西湖醋鱼
West-lake vinaigrette fish,

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,960
# 它就可以用香醋
you can use vinegars like Zhengjiang vinegar

149
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,000
# 镇江香醋
you can use vinegars like Zhengjiang vinegar

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,880
# 现在西湖醋鱼也改了
But in recent years chefs have changed,

151
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,400
# 人家不在用
They no longer use Zhengjiang vinegar

152
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
# 镇江香醋
They no longer use Zhengjiang vinegar

153
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,400
# 人家还为了柔和颜色
They mix Zhengjiang vinegar and rice wine vinegar

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,040
# 香气够拟出一种特殊的香味
to create a specific taste and color.

155
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,400
# 他还跟镇江香醋和米醋
to create a specific taste and color.

156
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
# 两种醋
to create a specific taste and color.

157
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
# 调和得出来
to create a specific taste and color.

158
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
# 西湖醋鱼
Making the West-lake vinaigrette fish taste even better.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,000
# 所以这味道就更好
Making the West-lake vinaigrette fish taste even better.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,920
# 所以说这个东西
It all boils down to the fact that Chinese culture is quite regional,

161
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,480
# 就是说
It all boils down to the fact that Chinese culture is quite regional,

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
# 就说我们中国文化
It all boils down to the fact that Chinese culture is quite regional,

163
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,440
# 还是区域地域文化
It all boils down to the fact that Chinese culture is quite regional,

164
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,080
# 是吧
Right

165
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
# 每个地域的东西
The eating habit depends quite heavily on the region

166
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,960
# 喜欢吃它喜欢的东西
The eating habit depends quite heavily on the region

167
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
# 但是总的来说
But to summarize, if the dish is dark in color

168
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,440
# 颜色重的
But to summarize, if the dish is dark in color

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,880
# 是吧
But to summarize, if the dish is dark in color

170
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,000
# 要是可以使颜色深一点的醋
you use a darker-colored vinegar.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
# 有的是增香的
Some enhances its fragrance, while some adds umami

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
# 有的是提鲜的
Some enhances its fragrance, while some adds umami

173
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,200
# 你看香醋
The fragrant kind is there for the specific taste.

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,800
# 他就是香
The fragrant kind is there for the specific taste.

175
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,760
# 米醋香度就不够
Rice wine vinegar is just lacking that, because it just adds acidity

176
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,360
# 他只是提的酸味
Rice wine vinegar is just lacking that, because it just adds acidity

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,960
# 要颜色鲜艳点好看一点
If you want pretty colors, like pan frying bean sprouts

178
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,040
# 另外比如炒豆芽菜
If you want pretty colors, like pan frying bean sprouts

179

# 烹什么醋
What do you use?

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,800
# 就只能烹米醋
Rice wine vinegar, that's all you can use.

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,320
# 其它醋
If you use other kinds,

182
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
# 烹上以后
If you use other kinds,

183
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
# 一个是颜色上去了
you either have too dark color,

184
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,760
# 二一个是味儿太重
or it's too punchy.

185
