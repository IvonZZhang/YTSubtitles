# 这个肉加点葱姜泡一宿

# 泡一宿冲干净把水空完了之后

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,480
# 萝卜喜荤
Radish and meat are a good pairing,

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,040
# 比方说广东菜的萝卜牛腩
like the Cantonese dish "Luobo Niunan" (beef brisket with radish).

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
# 这个为了让它入味
To make the flavor penetrate,

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
# 轻轻地拍一下
we slightly smash it.

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,800
# 拍裂就行
As long as you see the cracks.

37
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
# 还不能变形 不能拍开了是吧
You still need to keep the original shape, don’t smash it over.

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,720
# 好了 可以了
okay, that’s it.

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,120

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
# 还有点蒜 香菜 足够了

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,280
# 炸点葱油是吧
Fry some onion oil, right?

46
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,520
# 叫它充分的能给它吸收了

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,720

# 这时候咱可以把加姜先放上
We can put the ginger first,

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
# 姜味先出来
so the flavor of ginger comes out first.

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,360
# 你要做红烧肉怎么个做法
How would you cook the red braised pork?

52
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,720
# 没做过葱烧红烧肉

# 先炼葱油 这是第一回

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
# 过去原材料它非常好

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,760
# 所以说现在我们需要把这些
That’s why we need to make sure that,

59
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
# 比如肉也好鱼也好
like when preparing meat or fish,

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,440
# 可能异味的东西比较重一些
or those with stronger odors

61
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
# 处理掉 让它更加香

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,040
# 师父应该是炸到金黄色吧 金黄色
Master, we should fry until the color changes to golden yellow, right?

70
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,440
# 过去做红烧肉基本不飞水
In the past, we basically didn't parboil for red braised pork

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,960
# 炒糖色之后 用糖直接裹直接粘

80

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,200
# 上料 上汤

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,400

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,480
# 慢慢的煸  肉就收缩了
