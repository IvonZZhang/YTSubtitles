00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,760
# 用牙签 一扎 扎它一下 要不它就崩了
Use a toothpick to pierce it, or it will collapse.

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,640
# 牙签别上有两个好处
There are two benefits of using toothpicks to tie it up,

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,120

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,080
# 第二 它不容易跑 这还挺好
Second, it restricts the intestine to move, which is pretty good.

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,040
# 多焯会 焯到紧实了 沫子打掉
Boil it until it is firm, then remove the foam.

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,480
# 你看这肠子 焯透了咱就给它捞出来
Look at this intestine, scoop it up until it’s done.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
# 冲洗冲洗 不冲洗有味儿

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,880
# 还有烧好的开水 倒过来
We have some boiled water, get some over.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,040
# 现在就放吗 放吧大爷 放 没事

# 白酒和黄酒一块加更好
White spirit and yellow rice wine are better together

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,160
# 去腥 白酒 都加上
To wipe off the raw smell, add a lot of while Spirit.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,080
# 这味一下子就提起来
Now we have the flavor.

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
# 少搁点酱油 这还不能颜色太重
Add a little of soy sauce, otherwise the colour would become too dark.

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
# 你还得炒糖色 少搁点
We also need to fry sugar. A bit, not too much

Boil it for over one hour if we don’t have a pressure cooker.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,320
# 白酒味出来了 这会它的脏器味就没有了
When we can smell the white spirit, then the organ smell is gone.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,240
# 让白酒挥发一下 再炖一下
Let the white spirit volatilize for a while.

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,040
# 你在里边一焖 酒焖出来味不出去

# 不能把脏器味过多的给压过去

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,600
# 为什么人说要六味 一定要有那脏器味

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,200
# 小香菜末 最好要香菜梗

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,000
# 但是今天刚出锅的 咱用牙签给它别上
But the one today we just get it out of pot, let’s tie it up with toothpicks.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
# 要不它就散了
Otherwise it would fall apart.

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,760
# 等做好了以后再把牙签抽出来

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,440
# 九转大肠 苦味虽然算一个味道
Nine Turn Intestines, bitterness is a flavour,

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,640
# 不是非要把糖炒苦了

# 要炒苦了也不对了

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
# 这个糖不停的在锅里边搅动
Keep stirring the sugar in the wok

107
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,360

When you are at home, use casserole if you have one.

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,640
# 没砂锅用铁锅也可以 砂锅不容易糊锅
You can also use wok if you don’t have casserole. It is less likely to burn it when using casserole.
