# State Banquet Master Chef - Shrimp Skin and Chinese Chive Wrap. Easy and Tasty.

# 简介

# 小友們好，今天老飯骨又要教給大家一道小菜——韭菜蝦皮卷煎餅！
# 這道菜美味的關鍵在於蝦皮的干焙、熗韭菜蝦皮的油還要提前加蔥和辣椒熗一會兒。照著視頻裡做出來的韭菜蝦皮，卷煎餅、卷生菜都是絕配！讓大爺、二伯讚不絕口，一個不夠再來倆！
# Hello friends, today Lao Fangu is going to teach us a kind of appetizer: Shrimp Skin and Chinese chive wrap!
# The key points of this cuisine are how to toast the shrimp skin, seasoning the cooking oil with green onion and chilli first. The fried shrimp skin and chive we made by following the video, would be amazing! You can eat with jianbing (it is like pita, but crispier), lettuces. Da Ye and Er Bai could not stop eating! They need one more!

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,360
# 您看虾皮洗完了 咱们切点葱
After washing shrimp, let’s cut up some green onions.

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,800

# 搁在一边备料
Put aside as prepare

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,160
# 切好了以后点火
Now we turn on the cooktop

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,960
# 把这虾皮攥攥 把这水攥出去
Clench the shrimp, get the water out of shrimp

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,560
# 咱们把这虾皮 这叫焙 干焙
Now we need to dry the shrimp, it calls toast.

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
# 不放油 焙干 焙干香气就出来了
No oil, just toast them, the aroma would come out

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,000
# 把这水气给它焙出去 让它酥脆
We need to dry them too, which makes them be more crispy

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,080
# 咱这虾皮这样焙干也行
We can toast the shrimp in this way

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,160
# 搁在托盘里搁烤箱里烤也可以
or you can put them in the baking tray and put it in the oven to toast

00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,800
# 已经支棱了 开始松散了 一粒是一粒

# 一定小火给它焙干了
It must use low heat to toast it.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
# 师父您看香味出来了吧
Master, the aroma has come out

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,280
# 现在闻的全是虾米皮味
All I smell is the aroma of shrimp.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,960
# 海鲜味
Seafood flavor

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,520
# 差不多了 好关火
Almost down, turn it off

37

Take it out of the pan

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,560

Let’s make some green onion oil

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,080
# 耗葱油是增加它的香味
The green onion oil can add its aroma

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,000
# 一般做韭菜是这样
We usually do that when we cook chives.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
# 做韭菜的东西不能搁生葱
When cooking chives, we cannot add any fresh green onions

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,640
# 炸点葱油特别好
It could be better to make some green onion oil.

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
# 因为 搁这生葱和韭菜一串味
The flavor would be tainted if we put the chives and the fresh green onion together.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,920
# 两个都是比较冲的味道
Both of them have the pungent smell.

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
# 耗着葱油
While making the onion oil,

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,680
# 咱们这儿切两刀韭菜
Now we are going to cut chives.

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
# 韭菜的头儿咱们不要
We do not need the end. 

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,280
# 尽量多使点叶子的部分
Use the part of leaves as many as possible

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,960

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,800
# 这就够了
That’s all

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
# 在这跟我们网友说一下
Now we need to remind our frends that

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,960
# 入伏的韭菜就不要吃了 韭菜发臭
It is better not to eat the chives at the hottest summer. They are stinky.

53
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,920
# 香气出来了
Now the aroma comes out

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,640
# 小点火 咱把这个葱别糟蹋
Turn it down. We could not waste the green onion.

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,040
# 都捞出来 留着待会炒菜使
Get all onions out, we need them to be used later.

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,520
# 关键步骤 火停着呢（最小火）
Attention! We turn it off (or keep the flame at lowest level)

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
# 这个油是热的
The oil is hot

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,200
# 把这个辣椒炝一下
Now put the pepper into the oil.

59
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,440
# 然后把辣椒捞出去 炸点辣椒油
Then get out the pepper. We make some pepper oil.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,240
# 要呲 一呲这香气就出来了
Must hear the sound, “chi”, it helps release the aroma.

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,400
# 用热油呲韭菜和虾皮
Now we put the hot oil on the shrimp and chives.

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,120

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
# 这是一个倒呲油的方法 叫炝
This way is called Qiang (transient fried)

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,600
# 这个虾皮刚才咱们已经焙干了
The shrimp now is dry.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
# 这一呲油
By the way Qiang

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,360
# 韭菜的香味和油的香味儿
The favor of chives and aroma of oil

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
# 全都能吃到虾米皮里边
All in the shrimp

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,680
# 吃油了以后 也透明了 也酥脆了
Shrimp with oil would be more transparent and more crispy

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
# 韭菜也不会有烂韭菜的味
The chives would not be tasted like be decayed

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
# 盐呢 要不要 刚才洗的有点咸味
How about salt? Do we need to add some salts? We left some salt when we washed the shrimp

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
# 所以其它的调料就不用加了
Thus, we do not need to add extra seasonings
