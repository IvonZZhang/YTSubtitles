44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440

45
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,200
# 葱姜酒水
Water infused with scallions, ginger and wine

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,480
# 黄酒 花雕
Huang jiu (rice wine), Hua diao (rice wine)

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,080
# 下一步我们先把锅点着了
Next step, let’s turn on the burner

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
# 放水不放水 放好了
Do we add water? Water was already poured in

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,080
# 这锅里头放这葱姜也得有个数量
There has to be exact numbers of scallions and ginger

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,840
# 三块葱三片姜
Three chunks of scallions and three slices of ginger

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
# 到时候往出挑的时候
The time you pick them out

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,680
# 我要拣出 得有三块四块 你心里有数
You have to remember how many you have to pick up

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,920
# 咱开始和馅儿了啊
We’re going to make filling

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,640
# 肉是六百克 一斤二两肉
The meat is 600 grams, One jin and two liang (0.6 kg)

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,520
# 现在有将近四百克（葱姜酒水）水
Now we have about 400 g water (scallion, ginger, wine made water)

57
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,880
# 但是这水不能全搁进去 就先搁一部分
Don’t pour water all in. Just pour a portion of water at first

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,240
# 淀粉两勺 大约在三十克
Two spoons of starch, about 30g

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,040
# 胡椒 白胡椒
Pepper. White pepper

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,960
# 少许
A little bit

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,920

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,520
# 盐 十克 清炖狮子头盐多一点不要紧
Salt. 10g. It doesn’t matter to have more salt to make stewed “Shizitou”

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,120
# 因为它在炖制当中会分解到这水里头
Because salt will dissolve in water during stewing

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,880
# 有的时候网友会看这盐是不是搁多了
Some people may ask whether the salt is too much

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
# 它不是搁多了 多不了
No, it’s not. It can't be

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,640
# 顺着方向 朝着一个方向
Follow the same direction

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,240
# 搅动 摔打
Stir and beat

68
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,840
# 这个盐不够 它摔打上劲儿不太容易
It’s hard to make meat “shang jing” if salt is not enough

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,200
# 盐的渗透力非常强
Salt has strong osmosis

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,080
# 另外还有刚才忘了跟网友交代一下
Besides,  I forgot to mention that

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,480
# 肉的肥瘦比例很重要
The ratio of fat to lean is important

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
# 肥四瘦六
40% fat and 60% lean

73
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
# 有人说了我不爱吃那么多肥肉
Some people are saying I don’t like fat

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,440
# 但是也要达到肥三瘦七
At least 30% fat and 70% lean

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,600
# 肥的占三成 瘦的占七成
Fat is 30% and lean is 70%

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,760
# 脂肪过于少 吃的口感不行
It won’t taste good with less fat

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,680
# 它没有弹性
It won’t be springy

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,720
# 你看这水没了 我们再加水
No water. We add more water

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,440
# 再搁点盐 二次下盐
More salt. It’s the second time we add salt.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,520
# 为什么啊 手感 弹性不够
Why? Because it doesn’t feel elastic

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,960
# 说明这盐不够 淀粉可还差一点
Which means salt is not enough.  Starch is also not enough.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
# 这就是您的（经验）
This is based on your experience

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
# 没有什么 我有绝对把握
I will never be absolutely confident

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,320
# 说一下弄得就合适 要有二次的
To make it perfect at the first time. There has to be a second time

85
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,680
# 你看这黏度不够 黏度不够您还打水
It’s not sticky enough. You add more water even it is not sticky?

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
# 那也得打水 到时候吃的时候不够嫩
There has to be some water or it’s not tender enough

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
# 你看一点点的
A little bit

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,160
# 这水千万别一次性加足 慢慢打慢慢渗
Don’t add too much water at one time. Add water slowly.

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
# 大爷您摔的还挺厉害
Da Ye you beat it hard

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,400
# 不摔厉害不行 它不起劲儿
It won’t “qi jing” if you don’t beat it hard

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,000
# 你这锅也开了 马上就炖上了
Water is boiling. Ready to go.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
# 马蹄 打上劲儿以后放马蹄
Water chestnuts. Add water chestnuts once the meat “shang jing”

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,920
# 大爷这马蹄还不少呢 大约一百五十克
Da Ye, there are lots of water chestnuts. About 150g.

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,600

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,960
# 摔馅的碗底一定要大
The bowl used to beat the filling has to be large

96
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,640
# 它摔的时候piapia
You can hear the sound of “Pia Pia” as you beat it

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,840
# 家伙事儿小了
The bowl is small

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,000
# 这底儿小 家伙事儿可不小
The bottom is small, but the bowl is not small

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,960
# 太大了也不行 好家伙 它就占了二斤肉
Too large is not good as well. It weighs like two jin (1 kg) meat

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,680
# 我们现在弄一个水淀粉的碗
Now we are going to make a bowl of slurry

102
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
# 然后大爷那小手就抖起来
Da Ye, show us your shaking hands

103
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,800
# 我本来就抖
My hands always shake

104
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,520
# 锅开了
The water is boiling

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,760
# 咱们按标准做大约在二两吧
We make standard sized meatballs, about 2 liang (100g) each

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,840
# 您这个太大了 吃不了
This is too big. Too much for one

107
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,040
# 俩人一个 不是一人吃
One for two persons not for one person

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,680
# 一个人吃你肯定吃不完
One person can’t finish it

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,560
# 如果有蟹黄 现在可以把蟹黄放进去
If you are using crab roe, you can put it now

# 蟹肉放到这个馅里头 蟹黄放到浮头
Mix the crab meat with meat filling and put crab roe on the surface

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,320
# 我放着海米行不行 海米不行
Can I add “Hai mi” (dried shrimp)? “Hai mi” is not ok

112
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
# 为什么不行 行是行 但是要切碎
Why not? You can but you have to mince it

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,840

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,600
# 您这狮子头个儿可不小 得二两
Your “Shizitou” is not small. There is 2 liang (100g).

115
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
# 淀粉使得表面光滑
Starch makes surface smooth

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,000

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
# 加强肉表面的拉力
Strengthen the surface tension

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,320
# 遇热它糊化表面特别光滑
Starch gelatinizes once heated, which makes meatball surface smooth.

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,560
# 还是徒弟会说 遇热糊化
Disciple is smart: starch gelatinizes once heated

120
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
# 如果你放四个它在里边跟游泳似的
It’s like swimming in the soup if you only put four in

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
# 在里边它不会来回跑是吧
So they won’t move, right?

This is called stewing in water

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,280
# 有的叫隔水炖
There is another method called stewing above water

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
# 隔水炖就是把它放在蒸锅里边
Stewing above water is to put it in the steamer

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,640
# 因为它隔着水了 隔水蒸
Because it is separated from water and steamed.

145
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,840
# 这两种方法它有一个什么样的好处
What are the benefits of these two methods?

146
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,320

147
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,760
# 不隔水炖 它出来的汤比较浓香味厚
Stewing in water makes soup taste rich and smell good

148
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,080
# 但是汤容易发白发浑
But soup looks white and cloudy

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,760
# 要蒸的话 汤清 肉嫩
Steaming makes soup clean and meat tender

150
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,880
# 但是有时候油漂出来的少
But oil come out less

151
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,600
# 这样直接炖的它油出来得多
Stewing in water makes more oil come out

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
# 你看为什么说
This is why we say that

153
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
# 做酒店做高档宴席的时候
When restaurants cook for high-end banquets

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,960
# 这汤炖完了就不要了 换成清鸡汤
The soup is thrown away and substituted by clear chicken broth

155
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,320
# 夏天那时候就爽了
So good in summer

156
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
# 小火
Simmer

157
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,560
# 狮子头现在上火炖 要炖多长时间
We are going to simmer “Shizitou”. How long will it take

158
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,040
# 两个小时甚至到两个半小时
Two hours or even up to two and a half hours

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
# 到三个小时都可以
Or even three hours?

160
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,520
# 别太长了
Don’t be too long

161
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,920
# 其实两个半小时是最好的
Actually, two and a half hours is the best

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,240
# 炖出来了以后肉酥软烂 汤清味浓
That way the meat is pulpy, soup is fresh and taste is strong

163
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,440
# 掀锅了啊二伯 大爷我看您休息够了
Er Bai, I’m going to open the lid. Da Ye you must have had a good rest

164
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,560

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,160
# 开锅滚滚
Water is boiling

166
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,480

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,760
# 我们刚才说的 三截葱 一截
Like we just said. Three chunks of scallions

168
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,600
# 大爷这白菜没盖上啊
Da Ye, where is the napa cabbage

169
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,400
# 白菜咱就不搁了 这个季节白菜不好
We don’t add napa cabbage this time. Napa cabbage is not good this season

170
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,760
# 这还一片葱 这又一片
There is a slice of scallion. Another one.

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,320
# 您刚才这做法都是很传统的

172
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,960
# 这就跟狮子脑子似的
It looks like lion brain

173
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,640
# 你见没有 大粒 这叫狮子头
Look at how big they are. This is called “Shizitou”

174
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
# 你兄弟不是干淮扬菜的
I am not a professional on Huaiyang Cuisine

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
# 但是能说出来吧
But I can tell

176
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,520
# 您这是大师啊
You are master

177
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,200
# 大师两回事儿 大师多了
it has nothing to do with master. Too many masters.

178
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,240

179
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,680
# 我们这时候要尝尝汤
Now we are going to have a taste of soup

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,520
# 因为我就加了点胡椒 黄酒
Because I just added pepper and huang jiu (rice wine)

181
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,760
# 盐没加

182
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,120
# 盐在狮子头里边 看它渗透有多少
Salt is inside the “Shizitou”. Let’s see how much it dissolved

183
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,720
# 正合适
Perfect

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,560

186
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,200
# 说一句什么话 说句心里话
To be honest

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
# 现在就合适
Right now is perfect

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,600
# 但是为了让它更加丰满一点
But I want to make it richer

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,160
# 我知道您为什么 再加点盐
I know why. Add more salt

190
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
# 因为你还得加上油菜呢

# 狮子头好了 我们这边又取了一个锅

# 这油菜必须要焯一下

# 因为它有青气味和涩味

194
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,400
# 南方的油菜心叫矮脚黄

195
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,960
# 就那种大脑袋的

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,080
# 那个菜心好 它甜 而且还面

197
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,000
# 咱北方的菜心就差点
The northern baby bok choy is not as good

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,240
# 所以要事先给它烫一下
So we blanch it at first

199
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
# 一方水土养一方人
The unique features of a local environment always give special characteristics to its inhabitants

200
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320

# 北方的油菜就稍微有点涩苦

202
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,840
# 但是一焯就没味儿了

203
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,040
# 焯油菜的别超太嫩了
Don’t make baby bok choy too tender

204
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,520

205
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,880
# 因为它变色以后在锅里面略微的
After the color changes

206
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
# 略微的给它再炖一会
Stew it for a short time

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,840

# 隋坡 好了啊

# 圆砂锅上桌 垫着一个盘子
