# |--------------------------- title should not be longer than this line ----------------------------|

# 简介

# 小友們好！咱北方人對麵食都情有獨鐘，今天給大家帶來一道家庭版本的手抓餅。
# 手抓餅最重要的是起酥，其實這點也不難，大家看完視頻就知道秘訣在哪兒了，在家也能操作起來。
# 還有就是手抓餅容易變硬，小友們做好最好當天吃完，也可以擀成餅以後直接凍起來，吃的時候現烙就好！
# 視頻最後還有我們的老飯骨叨叨叨環節，看大爺與二伯的莫逆之交！
# 今日互動小話題：你是從哪道菜認識老飯骨的？

# Hello friends, people from the North always have a fancy for dough foods. Today, we are presenting homemade flaky Chinese scallion pancake for you.
# Crispy is the most important thing for scallion pancake. It’s not hard to make the pancake crispy after you watch this video and find the secret trick. You can cook it at home.
# Getting too hard to eat is another problem for this kind of pancakes. It’s better to eat the pancake on the same day you make it. Otherwise, you can freeze the pancake straight away after you roll it out as a circle without cooking it. You can cook it whenever you want to have it.
# The last part of this video is our chatting and sharing time. We are going to share sworn friendship between Da Ye and Er Bai.
# Our discussion topic today is – Which is the dish you get to know us from?

# 我们给它稍微往里边放点大油

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,520
# 这样这面会更酥 搁大油是起酥的
This way can make the dough more crispy, adding lard is for crusted top purpose.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,600
# 你看这面水放进去之后
Look, after I put the water in this dough,

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,280
# 我们就是充分给它揉 充分的揉开
We are going to fully knead the dough. Fully kneading the dough.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,760
# 里边不要有这种生面 滋润了
We don’t want raw flour in the dough. Moist and supple.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,640
# 揉滋润了之后给它摔一下
After kneading the dough smoothly, slam(bang) the dough a little bit.

# 搁盆里饧个十五分钟 很快

# 看这盆多干净
Look how clean the pot is.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,080
# 师父咱们这个面饧着的时候
Master, while our dough is resting,

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,640
# 我们给它切一点点香葱
We chop some scallions  for it.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,800
# 香葱最好就用葱叶
I prefer to use leaves.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,040

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
# 这时候师父大爷您看
When you are looking at it this time, Master and Da Ye

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,520
# 我这儿准备了两款油
I prepared two types of oil.

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,400
# 这是猪大油 这是黄油
This is lard and this is butter.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,840
# 加完黄油之后手抓饼会更香
Adding butter will give our pancake more aroma.

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,960
# 有一种奶油的味道 而且还酥脆
It will have a taste of cream and crispy.

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,920
# 把猪大油融化一下
Let’s melting the lard.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,480
# 黄油 黄油和猪油一半一半 可以了
Butter, 50% butter and 50% lard. OK.

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
# 主要是把它融化 加点温度之后
It’s just to melt it. After warming it up,

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,720
# 我们把葱花给它倒进去
We add scallions into the mix.

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,760
# 倒进去之后不用使劲的煸炒
It doesn’t require lots of stir-frying after you put them in.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
# 关火就可以了
It’s okay to turn it off.

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,000
# 让它自然的就降温了
Let it cool down naturally.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
# 您看这香味马上就出来了
Look, the aroma is now spreading out.

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,640
# 这会我们把它倒到这个小碗里
Now we can pour it in this small bowl.

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
# 大爷您看这个饧好的面
Da Ye, look at this dough.

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
# 可以给个特写
Give it a close-up shot.

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
# 您看一拉它非常滋润了
You can tell how moist and suppl it is when you pull the dough.

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,320
# 表面非常光滑了
The surface is very smooth and glow.

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
# 稍微来点薄面
Let spread some raw flour.

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,680
# 我们把它拿出来之后
After we take it out,

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,960
# 稍微按一下 不要再揉了
Just gently punch down the dough, no more kneading.

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,800
# 因为本身这个面 饧是什么意思
Because of this dough itself, what does ‘resting’ mean?

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,840
# 就是让它懈劲 懈筋性
Resting means letting it slacking, losing its gluten.

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,400
# 那么你要再揉 它筋性又起来了
If you kneaded it more, more gluten would be produced in the dough.

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,720
# 所以就没有意义了
Hence, it is meaningless.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
# 所以为什么我问这个问题
So, why I ask this question?

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,480
# 让我们网友要知道这个环节
I want to let our online audiences understand this step.

53
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,560
# 因为有网友说我这面和的挺软的
As some audience says that ‘I made dough very soft,

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,360
# 怎么一烙出这饼又硬了呢
But after I pan-fry the pancake, it turns to be stiff.’

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,840
# 他二次又和了
Because he/she knead the dough twice,

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,960
# 所以二次大家不要再和了
Therefore, guys, do not knead the dough at the second time.

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,920
# 饧好了就直接用
After the dough is rested, just use it directly.

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
# 大爷您看我这面擀开之后
Da Ye, look at the dough I rolled out.

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
# 不用擀的太薄
No need to roll it into a very thin piece.

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
# 稍微有点厚度就行
A little bit thick is okay.

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
# 这时候我们稍微往上撒一点盐
Now we spread some salt on top of it.

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,920
# 如果家里边有花椒盐也行
If you have, pepper salt is okay as well.

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,320
# 你要不加其它东西它也有底味 也香
There is no need to add other stuff. It has base taste. Taste and smells good.

64
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,360
# 你要是面一点味道没有就不行了
It’s not okay if the dough doesn’t have any base taste from the wheat and flour.

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,200
# 您看刚才我们炸的油
Check the mix of the oil we fired just now.

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
# 这时候我们给它刷上去
We can brush it on top of it.

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,240

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,120
# 这饼一看就好吃
The pancake looks delicious.

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,720
# 我们再稍微往上撒一点干面
We add more raw flour on top.

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,600
# 可以给它折一下 再给它弄开
And we fold it, and open it.

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
# 这样也行
It’ll do as well.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,240
# 折一下弄开
Fold and open.

74
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,960
# 然后我们给它剌开 剌成小细条
Then we slice it into small thin dough stick.

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,000
# 别剌断 你剌断了也行
Don’t slice completely, it’ll work if you slice it completely.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
# 就是不剌断这样好操作一点
It’s easier to process if you don’t slice them completely.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,520
# 得 剌开之后 我们给它卷一下
De (local modal particle of Beijing area), after we slice it, we can roll it up.

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
# 不要怕油出来
Don't be afraid if oil is spreading out.

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,960
# 因为我们刚放干面了 不要怕油出来
Because of the raw flour we spread, don’t worry about the oil.

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,040
# 弄成之后我们给它稍微抻一下
After we shaped it, we can hand-pull it a little bit.

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,280
# 中间剌一刀 出俩
Slicing it in the middle gives us two pieces.

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,200
# 把这抻一抻 越抻越细 成了抻面了
More hand-pulled, thinner and it would turn into hand-pulled noodles.

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
# 有富余的油咱们再给它刷上点
Brushing some extra oil if more oil left.

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
# 它要不酥太怪呢
Will be weird if the pancake is not crispy.

85
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
# 您看这么抻完了之后
After hand-pulled the dough,

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,920
# 我们进行一下盘卷
We can start coiling it up,

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,120
# 咱们从一边盘也行 从两边一块盘也行
We can coil it from one side or both sides.

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,280
# 那么边上都有死面子你给切掉一点
Can you cut off the unleavened dough on sides if any?

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,920
# 两边一块盘也行 咱们就两边一块盘吧
Coiling it up from both sides. Let’s do it in this way.

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,280
# 两边盘 盘完之后给它摞上
Coiling up from both sides, and after that just pile it up.

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
# 这饼 绝了
This pancake is fantastic.

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,840
# 两个咱们就给它饧上了
Resting both.

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,000
# 饧多长时间 也得饧个八到十分钟
How long? At least 8 to 10 mins.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,920
# 让它把劲儿懈一懈 咱们好往薄了擀
Let it slack and lose the gluten inside so we can roll it out into a thinner circle.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,200
# 大爷您看我们这饼 饧好了
Da Ye, check out the dough. Rested already.

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
# 我们在外边摊儿上吃
When we are having scallion pancakes outside,

97
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,480
# 好多都不用擀的 直接用手
Most of the pancake are madding by hand only, they don’t roll it out by rolling pin.

98
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,840
# 没问题
No problems.

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,040

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,920
# 提溜过来 盖上盖儿
Pull it here and cover with lid.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920

102
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,640
# 这个饼因为熟的很快
As flaky scallion pancake is easy to be cooked,

103
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,960
# 所以说这个火不用给它太小 中火
It’s not necessary to use low temperature, moderate heat will do.

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,800

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
# 你看你大爷
Check out Da Ye.

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,640
# 专心致志 看着亮子
He is concentrating on looking at Liang Zi.

107
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,000
# 他亮我也亮
He sparkles and I will too. (It’s a pun. Liang means light, sparkle and bright in Mandarin)

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,280
# 咱们给它掀盖儿 看一看
Let’s open the lid and look.

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,000
# 因为煎锅它是一面有温度
As the pan will keep the heat inside,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
# 所以说咱们经常翻着点 来吧
We’d better flip our pancake more often. Let’s do it.

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
# 看着就酥脆
It looks crispy.

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,000
# 咱们给它稍微刷点油

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,960
# 㸆上了 这一下就好了就齐了
Simmer and get concentration (a Chinese cooking method, after the dish is cooked, use low heat to cook it more time until the juice is locked inside or the juicy is getting richer.) It cooked now.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,520
# 大爷香啊 真香
Smells so good. Da Ye. So good.

116
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,480
# 来 咱们起锅

# 为了保险起见 咱们看看

119
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,360
# 再嘘一下 把那面再嘘嘘
Steam it a little bit, and steam that side. (Chinese cooking method, use steam to cook the dough food after turning off the heat)

120
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
# 齐活 出锅
Well done! Take it out!

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,760

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,800
# 你看讲究 这还有吸油纸
Look how fussy I am, oil-absorbing sheet is prepared.

123
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,160
# 咱们稍微给它蓬松蓬松 太酥了
We can gently make if fluffier, too crispy.

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
# 拖到盘上 一条一条的全开了
Pull it on the plate, each flake of pastry is unfolding from the pancake.

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,240
# 齐了 太好了
Perfect, wonderful!

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120

This is the real grasp flaky pancake. (It’s a pun. It named as Hand-grasped-pancake in Chinese)

133
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,040

134
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,200
