# 这一泡这味就能进去了
The flavor goes in once we peel and soak them.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,440
# 要不剥皮这菜质量大打折扣

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,560
# 你要用水就不是这味道
If you use water, it won’t smell the same.

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,320
# 开火了（话梅）就搁五个就够了
The heat is turned on. Five (Huamei) is enough

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,880
# 冰糖不用太多了 你看这个菜多简单啊

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,960

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,720

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,440
# 过下箩 话梅里边有黑渣子
Let’s sieve this, there are some dark residuals from the Huamei

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,480
# 看 这来块纱布是非常好的
See, it’s good to have a gauze to filter them out.

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
# 干净纱布 这个渣子完全都给清理干净了
A clean piece of gauze. All residuals are filtered out.

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
# 然后这西红柿咱也稍微热一下就行了
Now let’s heat the tomatoes a bit,

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
# 因为刚才（生水）冲洗了一下
since we just washed them with unboiled water

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,760
# 好捞 别太开了
Okey, fish them out. Don’t let it boil.

# 漂亮
Beautiful.

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,000
# 话梅直接浸在里边

# 继续让它释放它里边的味道

# 这夏天 这要喝起来 诱人呐

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
# 长这么大不吃西红柿
I don’t eat tomatoes, haven’t eaten any in my life.

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
# 大爷您得喝口汤吧 喝口汤
(Er Bai):Da Ye, at least you have to have some soup (Da ye): Sure, have some soup.

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,320
# 先尝汤 凉爽
Have some soup first. Refreshing.

73
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,360
# 我跟你说XB我都很少喝
Let me be honest, I rarely drink Sprite.

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,880
# 但是它这个话梅和XB的结合 真是完美
But putting it together with Huamei is just perfect.

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,040
# 夏天来一碗这个 绝对是解暑降温
Have a bowl of this in the summer will definitely relieve the heat.

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,200

This is definitely going to be trendy if you sell this at a stall.

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
# 这网友问说
One of our subscribers asked,

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
# 我蒸出来的包子皮
“The wrapper of my baozi, ”

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,640
# 虽然说也能正常起发
“ although they rise normally, ”

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,840
# 但是总是没有外面卖的包子
“they never look like the ones sold outside.”

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
# 皮口感软嫩白细
“the wrapper is not as soft or white, ”

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
# 而且底部总有一些透馅
“ and the bottom is always broken”

83
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,600
# 请指教
“Please advise.”

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,880
# 我不知道这位网友
I don’t know if this subscriber

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,360
# 是用老肥还是酵母
used pre-ferment or yeast.

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,760
# 以酵母为准
Assuming that yeast was used,

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
# 因为老肥现在很多人不常用
as not many people use pre-ferment now.

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,160
# 因为酵母发了以后
Once you developed the yeast,

89
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,720
# 和面的时候里边要搁一点糖
add some sugar when making the dough.

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,560
# 白糖
White suger.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,200
# 但是说家里要有不吃糖的
But if someone don’t/can’t eat sugar,

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,720
# 也可以不放
They can skip it as well.

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
# 吃包子最好用熟馅
It is best to make baozi with cooked filling.

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,200
# 尽量别用生馅
Try not to use raw filling.

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,120
# 是吧
Right.

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
# 因为生馅你蒸的时间
Because you would have to steam it for longer

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,760
# 就会长
if using raw filling.

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,200
# 就容易底蒸漏了
It is more likely to break the bottom (of the baozi).

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
# 这个时候大约在两个三个小时
Right now it takes about two to three hours,

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,080
# 现在按夏季说
Since now it’s summer.

101
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,520
# 两三个小时这面就发了
Two to three hours for the dough to rise.

102
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,640
# 发了以后
Once it rose,

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,720
# 要把这个面搁到案板上
Put the dough on the cutting board.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,160
# 揉一揉
Knead it.

105
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,280
# 揉一揉开始做剂儿
Knead it and start making Jizi (small pieces of dough to be rolled out into wrappers)

106
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,320
# 然后就开始包包子
Then the wrapping can begin.

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,720
# 你包好包子往哪搁啊
After you’re done wrapping, where to put it?

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,360
# 就直接搁到锅里边
Put it directly into the steamer.

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,320
# 放上凉水
Pour in cold water (into the pot).

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
# 刷上油
Brush some oil (on the steamer basket).

111
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,680
# 把包子直接搁屉上
Put the baozi directly onto the steamer basket.

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,440

After the wrapping is done,

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
# 盖上锅盖
Close the lid.

114
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
# 饧发
Let it rise.

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,800
# 十来分钟
Around ten minutes.

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
# 一会看这包子
Then you will see the dumplings.

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
# 不就长起点来了
All risen.

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
# OK
OK

119
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000
# 开始开火
Then turn on the heat.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,920
# 开锅算十分钟
Once the water begins to boil, count ten minutes.

121
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,480
# 你蒸了十五分钟坏了
Steaming for fifteen minutes makes it overdone.

122
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,400
# 底儿漏了
The bottom will break.

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
# 十分钟关火
Turn off the heat after ten minutes.

124
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,880
# 别掀盖
But don’t open the lid.

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
# 稍微蹲一会
Let it sit for a while.

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
# 让它闷一闷
Let it continue to steam.

127
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,840
# 让那气回落一下
Let the steam condensate.

128
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,480
# 这包子出来就好了
Then the baozi is done.

129
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
# 如果你要用生馅
If you use raw fillings,

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
# 如果你蒸的时间再长
If you steam longer,

131
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,400
# 醒发的时间也长
Rise the dough longer,

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
# 出来以后
after it comes out,

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
# 这包子底下就漏了
the bottom of the baozi will break.

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,480
# 尽量吃包子
Try to use cooked fillings.

135
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,440
# 一定要用熟馅最好
When making baozing, cooked fillings are the best,
