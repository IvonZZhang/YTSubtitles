# 简介

# 小友们好，又见到你们最爱的大大爷了！大大爷这次带来一道老北京传统小吃炸三角！
# 炸三角的馅料传统做法应该有焖子，咱们这次用的凉粉，小友们家里有宽粉丝也可以用。
# 具体的做法小友们快点击视频，要注意的是如果下锅的时候不是一锅炸的，最后可以一块儿回下油，保持一个温度出锅！
# 做好的炸三角外皮酥脆，包含着香菜的香、葱香、芝麻香还有胡萝卜香。二伯说吃这炸三角吃到了人生五味，小友们觉得呢？
# 以前有小友看到老饭骨的视频就在各种平台上咨询我们，如何入行做一名厨师。大爷和二伯这里有一些很中肯的建议给各位还没入行的学生，都是过来人的经验之谈！
# Hey friends, your favorite Da Da Ye is here! Today, Da Da Ye brings a traditional Beijing snack, Chinese samosa!
# Stuffing of Chinese samosa usually contains Menzi (starch jelly), but today we use Liangfen (mung bean jelly), if you have wide fensi (vermicelli) it’s also acceptable.
# Friends, click and watch the video for specific procedure. Pay attention that if you fry the samosas separately, you could put the early cooked ones back to the pan to heat for a while. Make sure they are served in the same temperature.
# Samosas are very crispy with the aroma of cilantro, green onion, sesame and carrot. Er Bai says he can taste the flavors of life through this samosa. How about you?
# Some friends have asked us how to become a chef on various platforms. As experienced chefs, Da Ye and Er Bai have some genuine suggestions for students stepping into a career of chef.
