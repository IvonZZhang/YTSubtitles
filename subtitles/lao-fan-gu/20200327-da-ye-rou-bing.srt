# 简介
# 【国宴大师•大爷肉饼】大爷烙了个爱心肉饼，大妈可劲捧哏，这碗狗粮我先干了 |老饭骨
# 小友们好，大爷在家猫了四十来天，可想死你们了！
# 今天大爷做这家庭版肉饼，笑的很腼腆，但是干的特起劲！
# 原来因为这一期，是咱大妈捧哏、掌镜。大爷大妈一来一回，甜丝丝的幸福都要溢出屏幕喽！
# 而且这期超长待机，大爷大妈一边唠嗑话家常，一边和面揉馅，真是有滋有味的幸福生活，狗粮都要吃饱了！
# 特殊时期，大爷二伯三叔不串门、不聚会。小友们也要尽量避免去人多的地方哦，大家伙儿可以借此机会在家多多练习自己的厨艺！
# Hello friends, Da Ye has been staying at home for about forty days. Really miss you guys!
# Today Da Ye is going to make a family edition meat pie. With a shy smile, he does some good work.
# Because this video is shot by his wife Da Ma, this episode is extra long because of the back and forth conversation between them while Da Ye prepares the dough and fillings. What a happy life. 
# Because of the epidemic, Da Ye, Er Bai and San Shu do not visit each other or gather. You should avoid social contact and crowds as well, and can maybe use this period to practice your cooking skills!

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,600
# 拍摄的人是我们老伴儿 成老师

# 也是你们大妈
You may refer to her as "Da Ma" as well

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,600
# 大家好
Hi everyone

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
# 现在就开始 先和面
Let’s get started with kneading the dough

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,920
# 和面很重要
kneading the dough is very important

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,600
# 我们常说叫
We often say

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
# 软面饺子硬面汤
Soft dough for dumplings, hard dough for noodles

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
# 烙饼的面 肉饼的面
When preparing flatbread or meat pie

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,720
# 面一定要软和
The dough has to be soft

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,320
# 我今天和这个大约有二斤面
I'm using about 1 kilogram of flour

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,840
# 大约一斤面 大约六两水左右
You need about 600ml water for a kilogram of flour

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,520
# 就用凉水和就行了 和的要软
Just mix with cold water. The dough must be soft

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,640
# 多软啊 有的说拿不起个儿来
How soft? Some said so soft that you can’t pick it up

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,880
# 其实不是 它还能拿起个儿来的
But no, you should be able to pick it up

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,280
# 就是越软和越好
Still the softer the better

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,520
# 你和面用的是什么面 标准粉
What flour do you use for the dough? All-purpose flour

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,720
# 一定要用标准粉
You have to use all-purpose flour

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,000
# 用高筋粉不行
High gluten flour won’t work

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,600
# 高筋粉烙出面有劲儿
High gluten flour would make the dough too tough

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,880
# 刚开始和 面可能不太滋润
We just started to knead the dough, it might not be very moist

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,440
# 疙疙瘩瘩的
Not quite smooth

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,240
# 等让它和好以后 让它饧一会
Let it rest for a bit after done kneading

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,600
# 待会儿我们有一个二次再进行揉
We are going to knead it again later

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,480
# 这样的面就滋润了
So the dough would be moist

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,080
# 这面就和好了
And the dough is ready

34
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,160
# 找块布给它盖上 饧着
Cover it with a piece of cloth and let it rest

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,400
# 饧面这个环节大约得二十来分钟
It's going to rest for about 20 minutes

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
# 下一步咱就开始打馅儿
Next we are going to start making the filling

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
# 搁点盐 这是猪肉
Put in some salt and here’s pork

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
# 大约在十二克 根据肉的多少
About twelve grams. It depends on the amount of meat

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,760
# 胡椒 还搁胡椒呢
Also put in some pepper as well

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,400
# 什么胡椒 白胡椒
What kind? White pepper

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
# 酱油有很多种
There are many kinds of soy sauce

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
# 你随便 你喜欢吃哪种酱油都可以
Put whatever kind of soy sauce that you like

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,800
# 放点老抽
Putting in some dark soy sauce

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,280
# 放点黄酒
Put in some yellow rice wine

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
# 黄酒有绍兴黄酒
Typically it's Shaoxing rice wine

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,080
# 我今天用的是福建黄酒
But what I’m using today is Fujian rice wine

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,720
# 一般打馅家里边
Usually when we make fillings at home

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,920
# 都习惯用筷子用尺板
We use chopsticks or stir sticks

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,280
# 为了让这肉更加滋润
In order to make the meat more moist

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,160
# 我就用手打馅
But I will just use my hand to mix the filling

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,040
# 这样打出来以后会更好
After I mix like this it will be better

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,080
# 这油得最后放
The oil should be put in at last

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,440
# 这颜色还不太行
The color is not there yet

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,160
# 北方吃馅 都要搁酱油
Northerners always put soy sauce in their fillings

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,640
# 颜色稍微重一点
The color would be a little darker

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,000
# 南方有的馅
Fillings from the south

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
# 你像包子馅 饺子馅
Like baozi filling and dumpling filling

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
# 他们很少搁酱油
They rarely put in soy sauce

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
# 所以北方和南方在做馅当中
So between northern and southern filling recipes

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
# 有它的区别
There are differences

61
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,720
# 朝着一个方向
Only in one direction

62
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
# 你看这馅越摔越紧实
See the filling is becoming tenser after throwing it

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,320
# 越摔越有劲
Throw it more to be tenser

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,840

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,800
# 这郑大爷真卖力气
Da Ye is working really hard

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,120
# 这就好啦
That’s done

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
# 有时候为了让这馅还嫩一点
Sometimes to make the filling more tender

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
# 还可以打一点水
You can also put in some water

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
# 打水可以打葱姜酒水
You can put in some ginger and green onion wine

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
# 也可以打咱们普通的白水
Or just use water

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,880
# 这个肉馅很重要
The meat filling is really important

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,080
# 肥瘦大约是三比七
The proportion of fat and lean meat is 3 to 7

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,720
# 有的可能喜欢再吃肥一点的
Some of you might like the fat

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
# 可以四比六
You can also do 4 to 6

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
# 太瘦了就不行了
But you can’t make it too lean

76
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,760
# 太瘦这个馅打出来又硬
If it's too lean, the filling will be too tough

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,320
# 干 不香
Dry and doesn't smell good

78
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,600
# 这馅打好了
Now the filling is ready

79
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,960
# 你看看这打好的馅
Check out the filling

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,240
# 这个大家可能见的少 这叫尺板
You probably haven’t seen this before. This is a "Chi Ban" ("ruler")

81
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,400
# 有的管它叫馅尺子
Some would call it a filling ruler

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
# 包饺子 包包子
While making dumpling or baozi

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
# 有这么一个小玩意儿好使
This is very helpful

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
# 使筷子不得劲
Chopsticks don't work very well

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,360
# 这时候里边要放点油
And now put in some oil

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,680
# 好一点的花生油 葱油都行
Good peanut oil or green onion oil will do

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
# 再放点香油
And some sesame oil

88
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,640
# 给它封上拌匀
Now mix it well

89
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,000
# 大爷不是做面食的
Da Ye doesn’t specialize in pastries

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
# 功夫跟专业的老师还不太一样
He doesn’t do it like the professionals

91
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
# 主要是家庭版的
Only homemade editions

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,520
# 这边放点姜 切好了 放在上面
Now put in some ginger. Cut it and put it on the top

93
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,240
# 下边切葱 按照我个人体会
And now cut the green onion. As in my personal experience

94
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
# 这葱在我们拌馅的时候
When we make the filling

95
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,720
# 什么时候开始烙饼
The moment you start cooking the pie

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,880
# 什么时候这葱拌到馅里头去
You mix in the green onion

97
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,120
# 不要过早的拌 过早的拌
Don’t do it too early. If you do it too early

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
# 这葱经过和肉馅的接触
The green onion is in contact with the filling

99
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,600
# 因为肉馅里边有盐
Because there’s salt in the filling

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,240
# 一接触把这葱的味道就给泡出来了
It would make the smell of green onion very obvious

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,000
# 一泡出来以后有点臭葱味
Once that happen, the smell will be all over

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
# 这葱最有味的是哪儿啊
What's the part of a green onion with the strongest smell?

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,720
# 是葱尾巴和葱芯儿
The bottom and the inside

104
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,320
# 因为它里边含的水分大 葱味浓
Because it has more juice so the smell is stronger

105
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,560
# 甭管是吃包子 吃饺子
Regardless of baozi or dumpling

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
# 我们用点葱芯儿
We will use some green onion’s insides

107
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,760
# 大爷在家猫了有四十天了
Da Ye has been staying at home for about forty days

108
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,960
# 四十天干什么呢
What did I in the forty days

109
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,080
# 净做饭了 变着样儿的做
Just cooking. Making all the different dishes

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,320
# 这一变着样儿的做
Making all the variations

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,680
# 我们可感动了可感动了
We are really touched

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,360
# 感动吧 好吃
- Really touched?
- So tasty

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,240
# 看大妈都感动了
See Da Ma is touched

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,320
# 不光我一人感动 全家人都感动
Not just I’m touched, our whole family is touched

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,640
# 葱啊别剁得太碎 太碎了
Don’t chop the green onion too fine. If it's too fine

116
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,360
# 这个葱盐一出来水分就跑掉了
Once the green onion touches the salt it will lose all the juice

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,200
# 你看这葱不少吧
See we have quite some green onion

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,480
# 这馅呢 我们一会做的时候再和它
Let’s mix the filling again later while cooking

119
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,960
# 现在都弄好了 咱们休息一会儿
Now everything’s ready. Let’s rest a little

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
# 等会儿那个面饧好了 就开始烙
When the dough is ready, we will get started

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
# 行了 关机
Alright, turn the camera off

122
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,160
# 按这个 按这红的
Press that, press the red one

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
# 大爷开始烙饼了
Da Ye is making the meat pies now

124
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
# 大家看这面啊 很软
Check out the dough, it’s really soft

125
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,120
# 面一定要到这种程度
The dough has to be like this

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
# 因为它饧到家了
Because it has rested really well

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,040
# 饧到家以后 一揉 它就润了
Once it has rested well, we only need to knead a little

128
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,840
# 切成三个剂儿
Cut it into three

129
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,960
# 把这剂儿再分别揉一揉
And knead them separately

130
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,360
# 好了 我们把铛烧上
Alright Let’s heat up the pan

131
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,720
# 刚才说的啊 现拌
What we just mentioned, mix it now

132
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,400
# 这回把它和好了
Now it’s ready

133
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,680
# 有时候我们网友说
Sometimes ours fans ask

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,520
# 你怎么能看出来咸淡来啊
How can you tell if it’s salty enough

135
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
# 这些素的东西一放进去
When you put in the greens

136
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,080
# 它马上就会软 就塌下去了
It softens, and collapses immediately

137
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,240
# 就说明什么啊 盐够了
And that means it's salty enough

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,800
# 有的时候韭菜搁半天也不塌
Sometimes the Chinese chives don't collapse even after a long time

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,760
# 说明这盐不够 再补点盐
That means it's not salty enough and you need to add some more

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
# 闻着香吧 有香味了
Smells good right? The smell has come out

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,640
# 馅和好了啊 开始出剂儿
Filling is ready, let’s roll it

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,560
# 很多网友可能看见的都是擀的圆饼
Many of you guys might have seen round ones

143

# 饼铛 搁点底油
