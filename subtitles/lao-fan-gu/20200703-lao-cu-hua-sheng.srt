# 注：不太确定“小粒花生”这样译对不对，请检查

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,960

First of all

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
# 咱们得先轻轻洗一下
We need to rinse the peanuts for a bit

How do we know when they are fried well? We put a clove of garlic

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
# 什么时候这个蒜表面金黄了熟透了

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,880
# 这个花生也就基本上差不多了
The peanuts should also be good enough

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,840
# 小火 在这给我们网友提示一下

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,840
# 你看这花生下去以后它是冒大泡的
As you see, when we put the peanuts in, the bubbles are large

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,200
# 等我们越炸的时候
As we fry longer and longer

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
# 这油越来越变成小泡
The bubbles become smaller

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,800
# 就说明这个水分少了
It means there's less water left

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,280
# 这个不是时间的事
This is not about the time

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
# 是要把水分要炸干 这声音有点脆了啊
- It's about getting rid of the water completely
- It sounds a bit crunchy already

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
# 您看这个蒜已经金黄了
As you see, the garlic has turned golden brown

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,400
# 我觉得应该可以捞了

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
# 然后咱们这盘子上放张吸油纸
Then we put a piece of oil-absorbing paper on this tray

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
# 咱们把它摊在盘子里边 吸油 晾凉

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,000

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,240
# 咱们滴两滴白酒

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,440
# 可以保持这花生米酥脆
