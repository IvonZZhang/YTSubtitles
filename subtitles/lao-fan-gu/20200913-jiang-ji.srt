# 简介

# 小友们好，今天老冯可带来了他的绝活——酱鸡！
# 做这酱鸡需要养一锅老汤，养好这汤卤什么都很香，小友们一定得好好学！
# 老冯这次用的鸡是三年的老母鸡，本以为做出来会很柴，没想到用他的方法做，酱香油润、肉质细嫩，用手这么轻轻一撕直流油！
# 想知道秘诀在哪里吗？快点击视频😁老饭骨教你绝招！
# Helloe firends, today Lao Feng brought his specialty dish - Braised Chicken!
# For this braised chicken, we have to prepare a pot of braising broth, which if you do it properly, it will be great for braising everything. It’s worth learning!
# The Chicken Lao Feng used this time is 3 years old hen, which should be pretty dry. Surprising, with his way of cooking it, the chicken is juicy and tender. The juice of the chicken dribbles when you gently tear it.

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,920
# 还有最重要的一步呢 大爷

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,160
# 咱们得测一下盐度

133
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
# 咱不用嘴去尝它
We don’t taste it

134
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,160
# 一定要用盐度计去测它
We have to use the salinity indicator to test it

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
# 我看一眼
Let’s take a look

139
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,000
# 咱们炖了有四十分钟了

140
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,400
# 然后这时候最关键的一步
Now it’s the most important step

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,480
# 这是就是老汤 这样才叫老汤 冻状
