# 您看现在这个仁儿是散着的

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,440
# 加点白豆沙
Add in some lima bean paste

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,800
# 就因为加上这个 它才黏糊了
So that the filling can stick together better

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,360
# 然后大爷 我刚才还准备麦芽糖了
Daye, I also prepared some maltose earlier

59

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,720
# 再来点麦芽糖 行了够了
And a little bit maltose syrup. Ok, that's enough

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,240
# 咱们现在里边还得加点糕粉
We are also putting in some Gaofen, steamed sticky rice flour

62
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,520
# 糕粉来拌到里边让它馅好成型
So that it shapes better

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,880
# 糕粉咱们在网上也能买到

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,120
# 都在网上都可以买到
can be found online

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,080
# 给它和的粘稠能粘到一块
Mix it so that the ingredients can stick together

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
# 一会咱们给它分一下
We will divide the filling later

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,840
# 咱们一会做的饼是一百克的饼
We are making 100g mooncakes today

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,120
# 所以咱们皮和馅的比例是五五
So the ratio of the wrapper and the filling is 1:1

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,560
# 这就行了 五十克
This is enough, 50g

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,560
# 馅分好了 咱们和面
We have divided the fillings. Now let's mix the dough

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,480
# 然后把这糖先下去 一百五十克
First sugar, 150g

73
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,720
# 以前的皮儿里边不加这个（鸡蛋）
We didn't add eggs before

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,360
# 咱这一百五十克的糖
For 150g of sugar,

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
# 一个半鸡蛋 然后咱再加点水
We will add one and a half eggs and then some water

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
# 先打一下
Mix them together

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
# 把糖给它打化了
Until the sugar dissolve

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,000
# 咱把麦芽糖倒进去 二十克
Then add 20g of maltose

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,560
# 师父您看现在开始倒油了
Master, look, now we are adding oil

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,360
# 这油不能一次倒进去 得分批倒
Add the oil in batches

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
# 花生油就行了
Peanut oil will do

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,560
# 一斤面搁两百克花生油
For 1 Jin (500g) of flour, add 200g of peanut oil

83
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560

84
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
# 这就好了
That's it

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
# 咱们把这富强粉倒进去 一斤富强粉
Then some bread flour. 500g of bread flour.

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
# 咱们这为什么叫提浆月饼
Why did we use to call this Tijiang (golden syrup) mooncake

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
# 提浆是怎么来的
The Tijiang part

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,840
# 其实就是咱们以前的白砂糖
Is because sugar didn't use to be

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,600
# 没有现在的这么干净
as clear

90
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,440
# 所以就把这熬成糖浆
So we made it into syrup

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,640
# 现在咱们这糖浆都可以了
Now the quality of sugar is better

92
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,640
# 所以不用去熬这个转化糖浆了
We don't have to make the inverted sugar syrup

93
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,880
# 过去的提浆月饼皮也硬 馅也硬
Both the filling and the wrapper of the Tijiang mooncakes are harder

94
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,560
# 这回咱们加入鸡蛋就松软多了
But since we added the eggs, it will be softer and fluffier

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
# 还有蛋香味
And has the aroma from the egg

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
# 把它和滋润了
Knead the dough until smooth

97
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,600
# 然后咱们把它搁在盆里边饧一下
Then left it in the pot to rest

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
# 大爷咱这面饧的差不多了
Our dough is ready

99
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
# 咱们开始把它分剂子
Let's divide it

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
# 咱们做一百克的饼 五十克一个的剂子
Since our mooncakes are 100g each, we will divide the dough into 50g pieces

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,880
# 皮五十克 馅五十克 齐了
50g of wrapper and 50g of filling

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,440
# 包月饼了 咱把这个皮给摁开了
Let's wrap! Spread out the wrapper

103
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,320
# 把咱们刚才分好的馅包进去
And put the filling in

104
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,640
# 吃五仁月饼吃的就是馅
The most important part of a Wuren mooncake is the filling

105
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
# 咱们在家包
If we wrap it at home

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,360
# 五五也可以 四六也可以
The ratio can be 1:1 or 2:3 for dough and filling

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,040
# 看看这手法 这手得这样捂着
Look at the method, fold it with your hands

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,800
# 慢慢往里边一团 跟包菜团子似的
And slowly close it up, like making a veggie wrap

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
# 大师姐这小手巧
Dashijie's hands are very limber

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,920
# 您别夸我了 夸我一会包不上了
Stop praising me, what if I mess up later

112
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
# 这就好了 包好一个
That's it, the first one

113
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
# 看着啊 怎么打月饼
Watch carefully, how to shape it

114
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,720
# 咱们打点糕粉 什么叫糕粉大师姐
Now let's spread some Gaofen. -What is Gaofen, Dashijie?

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,920
# 其实就是熟面要细
It is just very fine cooked flour

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,600
# 如果没有糕粉 咱们把面蒸熟也可以
If you don't have Gaofen, you can use steamed flour

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,200
# 看着啊 这月饼怎么来的
Look, this is how mooncakes are made

118
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,960
# 给它压好了
Press it in

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
# 跟这压一下 为了让它平一下
Press it again so it levels

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
# 然后您看着
Then look

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
# 左一下右一下
Left and right

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,360
# 看看 老饭骨月饼
Look, mooncake by Laofangu

123
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,920
# 再来一块 二伯给照精细点啊
Another piece. Er Bai, can you film it closer?

124
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
# 我顾这头你顾那头
I'll film this side and you will film it from the other side

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,240
# 现在工厂有机械压
Now there are machines to make mooncakes in factories

126
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
# 但是咱们老饭骨的全是手工的
But all Laofangu mooncakes are handmade

127
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,320
# 手打五仁月饼
Handmade Wuren mooncakes

128
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,080
# 那时候我们一打打多少 十万块
How many did we use to make back then? 100,000 pieces in a row

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,360

130
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
# 摔月饼也得有把子力气 好家伙
To hit the mooncake press mold you need lots of strength

131
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,480
# 摔一天胳膊受不了
Your arms will be sore after a day

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,280
# 那时候我们都是排队
We used to take turns

133
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,160
# 一个人团馅  一个人揪剂儿 一个人砸
One person would mix the filling, another one would make the wrapper and one more person would shape the mooncakes

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,400
# 这三人一天 比如说弄两千块
In a day, three people needed to make, let's say 2000 pieces

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,440
# 不打完两千块不让下班 还有专门烤的
You couldn't get off work until you finish 2000 pieces. There was also someone who bakes the mooncakes

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,720

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
# 这得稳准狠
You have to be precise and strong

138
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
