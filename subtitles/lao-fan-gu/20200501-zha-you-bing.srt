# 简介
# 小友们好，之前很多小友留言说想学炸油饼，大爷专门去找了个在北京做油饼特别棒的老师傅，跟他学了这炸油饼。
# 这次的和面的配比也给大家做得更为精确，这样小友们在家做更容易成功一些！
# 有时候我们和面可能会黏手，想要做到手光、面光、盆光，咱们可以加点儿油！
# 大妈录像还不忘问大爷“送命题”，不知道大爷这回答能过关吗？
# Hello friends! Many friends commented that they want to learn youbing (deep-fried cakes).
# So Da Ye found a master chef in Beijing who is especially good in youbing, and learned from him.
# This time, we are giving exact ingredient amounts for the dough, to make it easier for the audience to follow.
# Sometimes the dough may stick to the hands. To make "smooth hands, smooth dough, smooth bowl", we can add some oil.
# While filming, Da Ma didn't forget to raise some tough questions for Da Ye. This time, can Da Ye still pass it?

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,240

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,080
# 有时候这面也有问题

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,880
# 有的这面它干 它吃水
Some flour is dry. It aborbs a lot of water

31
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,840

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,280
# 把面给它均匀的打成啰嗦
First we knead the flour evenly into strips

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,880

# 要手光 盆光 面光

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,320
# 基本上比烙饼的面 比较相似
It's similar to the dough for laobing (pan-seared cakes/pies)

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,880
# 就跟你上次做肉饼似的
译注：这里指的是往期视频大爷肉饼 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=085dZmraG4M
Like the meat pie you made last time

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,920
# 但是比那个要硬一点 得拿得起来
- But it's tougher than that

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,280
# 这个软硬程度差不多了是吧

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,360

Alright now

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,840
# 我们在和的时候 可能要会黏手
When kneading, it may stick to you hands

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,200
# 这时候怎么办

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
# 加点油 十克 花生油吗

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,840
# 这面和好了以后要饧一饧

# 饧个十来分钟 再揉一揉

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,080
# 刚开始和的时候效果都不是很好

60
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,680

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,760

# 你看这个越揉面纹越细
Look, the more we knead, the smoother it is

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,480

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,880
# 你看这个软硬也润了 光滑的

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,960

# 人家专业拉口
