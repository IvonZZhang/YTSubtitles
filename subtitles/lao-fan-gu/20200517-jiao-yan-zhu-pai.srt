00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,080
# 这粉子你要太薄了也不好
The cornstarch shouldn’t be too thin either

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,720
# 太薄了它就 那水分锁不住了 它不嫩
It wouldn’t be able to lock the juice if it's too thin. So the meat wouldn’t be as tender

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,560

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,200
# 这就差不多了 再复炸一下 脆一点
That’s about it. Double fry them later to make them crispier

83
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
# 油温坐高坐热
Wait for the oil temperature to rise

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
# 你看 这就酥了
Look, this is what I call crispy

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,160
# 复炸 复炸主要目的是表皮更脆
Now, double fry the fillets. The purpose of this is to make the crust even crispier

Use the heat from the wok

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320

92
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,320
# 你看这香 香气四溢 这是烹
Look at this. The fragrance is everywhere. This is called ‘peng’ (fry quickly in hot oil and stir in sauce)

93
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,600
# 满厨房都是香的
The fragrance is all over the kitchen

94
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,280
# 这汁一下就吸到肉排里去了
The fillets absorbed the sauce right away

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680

142
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,360
# 我跟庹师爷这个经历非常丰富
I had a long and wonderful relationship with Shiye Tuo

143
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,600
# 我跟他学的什么 学的是做人
What I learnt the most from him was how to be a better person

144
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
# 我今天跟你们徒弟说
I always tell you disciples and apprentices nowadays

145
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
# 其实我们说了半天菜
That although we are learning how to cook

146
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,560
# 关键是我们学做人
It’s crucial to learn how to become a better person

147
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,160
# 你做人做好了
If you are a good character

148
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,120

149
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
# 比如说大家都愿意帮你
Others would love to help you

150
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,000
# 愿意把东西掏心掏肺的给你
And give you their best willingly

151
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
# 你做人做不好 别人都躲着你
If you are a bad character, on the other hand, others would try to avoid you

152
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,480
# 所以说我今天可能多啰嗦两句
I might have said a few more words today

153
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,800
# 先把人做好
But you must first become a good person

154
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,880
# 这是根
This is the root

155
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,880
# 在家里边你师爷手把手的教我
Your Shiye taught me how to make kung pao chicken in the old days

156
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,160
# 这宫保鸡丁过去怎么做
Step by step in his house

157
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,480
# 因为他是按照老的传统的做法
Because he followed the traditional ways

158
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,440
# 实际上我跟你师爷学的同时
In fact, in the meantime I learnt from Shiye

159
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,320
# 因为庹有华的关系
Because of Shishu Tuo Youhua

160
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,600
# 当时你庹师叔在四川饭店当厨师长
Being an executive chef at Sichuan Hotel at that time

161
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,080
# 我又跟陈松如老爷子又有所接触
I was also in contact with Chef Chen Songru

162
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,560
# 两位在京城德高望重的川菜大师
These two highly reputable Sichuan Cuisine master chefs in Beijing

163
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
# 在我人生的厨艺道路上
Provided me with tremendous help

164
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
# 给了我不少的帮助
In my career as a chef

165
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,440
# 所以说我从他们身上学到了
So I learnt to cook the authentic traditional flavours

166
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,480
# 正宗的这种老的味道
From both of them

167
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,440
# 我记得八四年的时候
I remember, in 1984

168
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,040
# 整个旅游局
The National Tourism Administration

169
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
# 全旅游局系统了之后考试
Implemented systematic culinary tests for all succeeding chefs

170
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
# 那时候考试难 六个菜
The tests were quite hard as we had to cook 6 dishes

171
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,520
# 八四年我是整个旅游局的第一名
I was ranked number 1 in the National Tourism Administration among all chefs

172
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,240
# 然后宫保鸡丁 十分满分

174

# 我在宴会在上这道菜经常出现
I cooked this dish all the time for banquets

176
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,320
# 华都饭店当年主要是宴会太多
Huadu Hotel held so many banquets those years

177
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,120
# 宴会 大量的宴会你都做不完
Endless banquets

178
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
# 这段经历磨练我在哪儿呢
What did I learn from that experience?

179
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
# 我就把这鸡丁给改了
I changed the diced chicken in the dish

180
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
# 因为鸡丁它上不了档次
Because diced chicken was not presentable enough to be served in banquets

181
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,520
# 就改成大盘 招呼
I served kung pao chicken in large plates

182
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,080
# 用什么啊 用鸡腿肉改成宫保鸡花
With chicken thighs cut into the flower shape

183
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,760
# 大宫保鸡花 那吃着过瘾啊
It was so satisfying to eat big pieces of flower shaped kung pao chicken

194
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
# 主要是那时候用两种油
Essentially we used two kinds of oil

195
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
# 我用什么油封呢
Which oil did I use for confit?

196
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,720
# 用北京的花椒和四川的花椒
I fried Sichuan peppercorns from both Beijing and Sichuan

197
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,000
# 两种花椒炸出的油
In the oil to extract their flavours

198
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,840
# 用这个油 腌好了以后封这个菜
And then confit the marinated chicken with the infused oil

199
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080
# 当你鸡滑了下去之后
When you fried the chicken later

200
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,720
# 味道倍儿足 味道已经很浓了
The flavour was already very intense and sophisticated

201
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,920
# 又有淡淡的那种花椒的香气味
With a light touch of the aroma from Sichuan peppercorns

202
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,720
# 所以说这个菜
So this dish

203
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
# 就这菜出来就与众不同
Immediately stood out once it was revealed

204
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,200
# 其实在改革当中 创新当中

205
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
# 其实一个小的动作
A simple and small move

206
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,800
# 就能改变菜的整个的味道
Could change the entire flavour of a dish

207
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,720
# 你看我从二十几岁走到今天六十岁
Since I was in my twenties till today when I’m 60

208
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,680
# 这宫保鸡丁从来就特别火
Kung pao chicken has always been a crowds’ favourite

209
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,280
# 其实无非就两个味型
It has nothing but two versions

210
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
# 一个是过去的糊辣
One is the traditional ‘hula’ flavour (spicy with slightly burnt spices)

211
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,080
# 现在属于荔枝口
The other one is called ‘lizhikou’ (added equal amounts of sugar, vinegar, and starch slurry)

212
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
# 荔枝口比较大的 有点小糖醋了
Some of the stronger ‘lizhikou’ dishes could even be called sweet and sour chicken

213
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
# 过去就是什么糊辣
In the old days, kung pao chicken was predominantly ‘hula’

214
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,920
# 主要是以糊辣为主 糊辣咸鲜
This popular flavour was smoky, spicy, savoury and umami

215
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,200
# 它以这个为主
The majority of the dish were cooked that way

216
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,520
# 现在这东西 糖和醋的比例大了
But now, more sugar and vinegar are being used

217
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,360
# 过去的就是几种流派
In the past, we only had a few styles of cooking kung pao chicken

218
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
# 四川饭店的不让加辣椒面
At Sichuan Hotel, chilli powder was not allowed to be added to the dish

219
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
# 就是原汁原味
The flavour must be original and authentic

220
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,320
# 你师爷饭店包括北京饭店
While your Shiye, along with Beijing Hotel

221
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,840
# 可以加辣椒面
Added chilli powder to it

222
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,560
# 在煸炒当中 然后推辣椒面
During stir-frying, chilli powder would be generously incorporated

223
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,440
# 这辣椒面有一种非常
The chilli powder

224
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,360
# 辣椒这种清香的
Had an intense spicy aroma

225
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,400
# 那种味道也很好吃
And it was equally delicious

226
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
# 这两个东西都很好吃
Both styles tasted fantastic

227
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
# 都各有各的特色
And both had their own characteristics

228
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,640
# 峨嵋酒家为主的宫保鸡丁 糖醋
Sweet and sour kung pao chicken from restaurants led by Emei Hotel

229
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,480
# 现在又是一个流派的版本
Has now become another noticeable style

230
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,640
# 跟师父这么多年 总结了很多经验
After so many years following my master, I have summarised quite a few tips from my experience

231
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,160
# 我觉得比方说
For instance

232
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,200
# 从宫保鸡丁来说
Taking kung pao chicken for example

233
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,520
# 我觉得从两个点入手
In my opinion, we can start with two points

234
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
# 第一点 传承的东西口味的不要变
Firstly, don’t change the flavour of something that has been passed on for generations

235
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
# 宫保鸡丁也好
No matter it’s diced kung pao chicken

236
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,640
# 宫保鸡花也好
Or flower-shaped kung pao chicken

237
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,680
# 宫保鸡条也好
Or kung pao chicken fingers

238
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
# 改变一下 原来滑油
If you want some changes, chicken used to be fried

239
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,840
# 我现在等于是
Now I can do this

240
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,640
# 给它挂师父做的生熟糊
Coat the chicken with the shengshuhu batter made by master

241
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,520
# 挂完了以后
Once coated

242
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,920
# 我底下是铺一铺披萨
Lay a pizza underneath the chicken

243
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,680
# 我上头撒上奶酪 往上一烤
Then sprinkle some cheese on top, and roast the whole thing

244
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,040
# 这是我的想法
That’s just my thought

245
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,960
# 我也不知道这样对不对
I’m not sure if it would work

246
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,320
# 师父您给看看徒弟这种想法
Could master provide some feedback on this idea?

247
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
# 其实你还算有想法
You actually have some interesting ideas

248
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
# 我要纠正的问题是什么问题
What I must rectify here is that

249
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
# 好多现在炒宫保鸡丁的
Nowadays, a lot of people who make kung pao chicken

250
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,320
# 都犯了一个致命的错误
Are making a critical mistake

251
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,080
# 在传承当中其实忽视了什么
What they have overlooked in the culinary inheritance

252
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,920
# 忽视了小料
Is the use of minor ingredients

253
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,600
# 小魏 同样的葱 比如宫保鸡丁
Xiao Wei, for spring onions, when you follow my steps

254
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,480
# 你看着跟着我
To making kung pao chicken

255
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
# 我一个是在调汁的时候
I add in spring onions and ginger

256
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,240
# 把葱姜蒜搁在里边
When making the sauce

257
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,920
# 还有一个是煸炒的
As well as when stir-frying

258
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,160
# 这样的它两方面加起来
With both steps combined

259
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
# 能够刺激这个东西的香味
The aroma of the spring onions can be stimulated

260
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,600
# 全部给激发出来
And extracted

261
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,120
# 但是你看 现在好多炒宫保鸡丁
But now, a lot of people only use spring onion sticks

262
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
# 大部分全是葱骨碌
When cooking kung pao chicken

263
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,320
# 这个根本就不是传承
This is not proper inheritance

264
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,880
# 它里头香味熟不了
The aroma would be trapped

265
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
# 它释放不出来
Rather than being released

266
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,680
# 其实葱那香气是在里边
The aroma of the spring onions is actually inside the stems

267
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
# 它里边的出不出来
And it wouldn’t be able to come out

268
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
# 我给它切了
Unless I cut them into smaller pieces

269
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
# 切完了两大好处
There are two benefits of cutting the spring onions

270
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,800
# 第一个是香味激发出来了
The first one is that the aroma can be released

271
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
# 还有一个是什么
And the other one is that

272
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,640
# 我搁多少葱它都看不见葱
You wouldn’t see the spring onions no matter how many I put into the dish

273
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,040
# 它永远突出这主料
So the main ingredients can always stand out

274
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
# 这过去传承
Knowing how to use minor ingredients

275
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
# 隐藏的其实是最大的好处
Is actually the real hidden gem of the culinary inheritance

276
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
# 其实在这
From the past

277
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,320
# 你们要知道这个好处
You must understand it

278
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
# 在这基础上 刚才小魏讲的
Based on this, like what Xiao Wei just said

279
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,200
# 你再激发你的灵感去创新
You can then use your inspirations to innovate

280
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
# 其实最重要的那底味拿住
The most crucial thing is to hold onto the base flavours

281
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
# 一下拿足了它
Firmly

282
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,800
# 这个菜 任何菜都是这样
It applies to kung pao chicken and any other dishes
