# Hello everyone! Today we invited Jun Song, the keeper and chef of Lao-Men-Kuang hotpot tripe and meat restaurant. He will bring us a bite of old Beijing: Doornail meat pie. Jun Song is both the pseudo son and disciple of Er Bai, so today he is going to share all the secret of making Doornail meat pie without any reservation! Audience, let’s learn about it by heart! Everything including making the dough and the meat filling has its own standard. You just need to follow the recipe to make a restaurant-standard Doornail meat pie!
# The ecstasy of eating the meat pie comes from the moment when you take a small bite and the flavorful juice from the meat filling spread all over your mouth. It has truly tender, juicy filling and caramelized, crispy shell!

# 你看这面和的
Look at how we knead the dough,

32
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,240

33
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,920

You cannot be lazy when kneading the dough

34
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,480
# 一点疙瘩都不行
The dough should not have any clumps.

35
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,400
# 这手有劲你看 有劲

36
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200

37
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,680
# 没问题

# 你看这小面醒这

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
# 由于烙馅（饼）和这面更（得）醒开了
It is critical to rest the dough long enough, especially for making meat pie

48
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,400

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,120

# 洗洗手 洗洗手
Wash hands

52
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
# 洗洗手弄那个花椒水
Next, we make Sichuan pepper extract

# 下一步该泡花椒了
Soak the Sichuan pepper with water

54
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
# 花椒水
Sichuan pepper extract

55
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,480
# 拿热水 开水
Use boiling hot water

56
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,560
# 拿一把花椒
take a handful of Sichuan pepper

57

# 花椒
Sichuan pepper

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,200
# 来点花椒啊

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,840
# 今天用的是牛肉
Today we use beef

60
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,040
# 是吧
There it is

61
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,800

# 花椒
Sichuan pepper

64

# 这花椒得用什么
What do we do with the pepper?

65
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,720
# 用开水泡泡
Soaking it with boiling hot water? - Yes

66
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
# 一百六十克水
Add about 160 grams of water

67
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,800
# 花椒有多少
How much pepper?

68
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,400
# 花椒有半两二十五克
about 25 grams of Sichuan pepper

69
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,280
# 这个用开水充分的激发出花椒的香味
Use boiling hot water to fully extract the aroma of the Sichuan pepper

70
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,520
# 这会该剁馅
Now let's chop and mince the beef

71
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,640
# 两斤肉啊
Two “jin” (1 kg) of beef

72
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
# 牛肉这是胸口
We use beef brisket

73
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
# 因为它有带油
Because it contains enough fat

74
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
# 有油才香
The fat brings a nice aroma to the filling, 

75
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,040
# 肉才不柴
And makes it tender

76
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,120
# 不能凑合
We can’t compromise the quality

77
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,200
# 肉要好要干松
The beef should feel dry and loose

78
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
# 你看这肉是吧
Look at this piece of beef

79
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,000
# 吃到嘴里一点水汽没有
When you eat the meat filling made from it, no excess moisture will remain

80
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,320
# 它原材料是第一
This depends first on the quality of the meat

81
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
# 第二就是和发
Second on how you mix the filling

82
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
# 二伯啊 哎
Er Bai. - Yes?

83
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,560
# 你得好好介绍一下宋军
You should introduce Song Jun

84
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,240
# 宋军就是老门框的掌柜的
Song Jun is the owner

85
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
# 也是当家人
And the head chef of Lao-Men-Kuang restaurant

86
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
# 既是干儿子
He is my pseudo son

87
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,560
# 是吧
Yeah

88
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
# 也是徒弟
And my disciple

89
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
# 你看啊大爷
Look, Da Ye,

90
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,080
# 所有的门丁肉饼不能用绞肉机绞
The meat used for Doornail meat pie should not be ground by machine

91
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
# （要）用手切馅
It needs to be chopped

92
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
# 然后剁
and minced by hand

93
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,040
# 为什么要剁
The reason to chop and mince by hand instead of by machine is that

94
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
# 它绞完以后不腻乎容易泄
Ground meat (by machine) is not sticky enough

95
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,560
# 它不往一块走
The meat does not stick together

96
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,240
# 腻乎就是抱团儿
Sticky means they can form meatballs easily

97
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,160
# 而且剁中粗就可以了
Also, we only need to mince it to medium rough

98
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,000
# 中粗它有嚼劲儿
Medium rough makes the final meat filling al dente, tenderly chewy

99
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,200
# 还越嚼越香
And taste better as we chew

100
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,440
# 一咬开一点皮吧
Take a small bite of the crust

101
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,560
# 咬一小口
Take a small bit

102
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,480
# 唰那汤流出来的时候
The meat juice spread out immediately

103
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
# 你能感觉太棒了
It feels so good

104
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,920
# 就是好吃的
Just delicious

105
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,720
# 我期待着
I look forward to it

106
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
# 毫无保留
Without hiding any secrets

107
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,360
# 我们该怎么做就怎么做
We will cook it as it should be cooked (in the restaurant)

108
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
# 但是头一次用
But this is my first time cooking it with

109
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
# 家用电饼铛
an electric griddle baking pan for home use

110
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
# 争取还原到店里的
I will try my best to reproduce the one we make in restaurant 

111
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,840
# 这种效果
The same quality and taste

112
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
# 电饼铛咱们这个温度上
The temperature settings of the electric griddle baking pans

113
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
# 也有点区别
Are different

114
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
# 大爷这个铛我都没使过
I have never used Da Ye's electric pan.

115
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
# 你没使过这是新买的
Of course you haven’t! This is new.

116
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
# 就为宋军这次来
Since Song Jun is coming, 

117
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,480
# 特地买了一个
I bought this specifically for him.

118
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
# 我要做不好的
If I don’t cook the best Doornail meat pie,

119
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,440
# 都对不起这铛
I will fail this new baking pan!

120
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,400
# 对
Yes!

121
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,320
# 差不多了
Almost done

122
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,120
# 成了你这不沾刀 不沾刀
It’s done! The meat does not stick to the knife

123
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,680
# 你看倍儿细腻
See how even and fine the minced beef is

124
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,400
# 好
Great!

125
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,160
# 搁一旁
Put it aside

126
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,960
# 好
Good

127
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
# 我给你说我真欣赏宋军
To be honest, I truly admire Song Jun

128
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,440
# 切点姜
Chop some ginger

129
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,040
# 下一步搁料油先炸洋葱
Next, we add some herbal oil: first deep fry onion

130
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,680
# 抽吧了以后捞出来
We fry until the onion shrinks completely then take out the onion, keep the oil;

131
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
# 再继续搁大葱香葱香菜根
Then we add spring onions, scallion, cilantro root

132
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,160
# 都是干了以后
Fry until they are dehydrated

133
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,200
# 一层层炸
one by one

134
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,920
# 炸到最后
Eventually,

135
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,840
# 我干爹出了一招
My honorary father (Er Bai) had an idea

136
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
# 搁个大菠萝
Put a big pineapple in, and fry it.

137
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,200
# 再把菠萝炸抽了以后捞出来
Fry until the pineapple is dehydrated and then take it out

138

# 满屋子都是香味是真香

142
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,160
# 为什么好吃的
The key to the delicious meat pie

143
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,560
# 就在这
Is right here

144
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,240
# 牛肉馅必须得油多点大一点（才）香
Beef meat filling needs more oil to taste good

145
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
# 然后黄酱 六必居的鲜黄酱
Then we add fresh yellow soybean paste from Liu Bi Ju

146
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
# 老北京的鲜黄酱
This is traditional Peking style fresh yellow soybean paste

147
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
# 再来点鸡蛋清
Then we add egg white

148
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,960
# 搁鸡蛋清
Egg white from two eggs

149
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,680
# 它还能拢一块
It helps the meat filling to stick together

150
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,240
# 下一步

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
# 花椒水
Sichuan pepper extract, in

152
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,600
# 北京的花椒
This is Peking style Sichuan pepper

153
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,480
# 用黄豆酱油
Add soybean soy sauce

154
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
# 五十克
Fifty grams

155
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,920
# 你看到没有
See

156
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,440
# 五十好
Now fifty grams

157
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,600
# 味极鲜
Seasoning soy sauce

158
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,040
# 五十克
Fifty grams

159
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,560
# 老抽四十（克）
Dark soy sauce, forty grams

160
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,320
# 这三样搁齐了
That’s the three ingredients

161
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
# 这脑袋是好使了
Such a smart brain!

162
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,000
# 都记下来
He memorizes everything

163
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
# 然后咱们再来一点点香油
Then we add a little sesame oil

164
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,800
# 来一勺就够了
One teaspoon is enough

165
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
# OK
OK

166
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
# 不搁盐
We don’t need to add salt

167
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
# 不搁味粉
No need for MSG

168
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
# 不搁鸡粉
No need for chicken flavored powder

169
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,120
# 为什么充分的体验
Why? Because in this way we taste

170
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,280
# 就是原汁原味淡一些
the original flavor. Not too salty

171
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
# 不要吃的太咸
Don’t eat too much salt

172
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,160
# 他为什么不慢慢加在这
Do you know why he didn’t add the ingredient step by step but all at once?

173
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,000
# 它的肉好肉要不行的话
Because the quality of meat is very good, otherwise

174
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
# 它一点点吃水
the meat can only mix with water bit by bit

175
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,800
# 最主要的还有一点
Another important trick here

176
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
# 咱们就这蔬菜汁去腥
We use vegetable juice to get rid of the bad odor and flavor of the meat

177
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,320
# 这厉害这个
This is impressive

178
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
# 切点胡萝卜
We slice some carrots

179
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,640
# 香菜
Cilantro

180
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,080
# 对
Right

181
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
# 洋葱
Onions

182
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,720
# OK
OK

183
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,600
# 蔬菜汁就是上次的时候
Last time, my master (means Er Bai here)

184
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
# 我师傅特意教我的
Taught me how to make and use the vegetable juice

185
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
# 那味儿 这里边就缺个芹菜
This smell good. Only missing Chinese celery here.

186
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,680
# 你看这个手劲
See how hard he squeezes the vegetables to get the juice

187
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
# 蔬菜的香味
The aroma of the vegetables

188
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,360
# 全都融入到这个
are completely extracted out

189
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
# 汁儿里
into the juice

190
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,560
# 如果说我们家里边有那个啥
If we have blender or juicer at home

191
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,040
# 榨汁机榨点汁更好
It’s even better to use it to get the vegetable juice

192
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,400
# OK了
OK

193
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,080
# 来了
Now it’s done

194
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,880
# 好
Great!

195
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,960
# 我先还得一有一个最重要的
One of the most important tricks

196
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,160
# 我不搁大葱
I don’t use spring onions here

197
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,320
# 我搁紫葱头不能搁白的
I will use purple onion

198
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
# 白的臭
Do not use white onion as it smells bad

199
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
# 紫的是甜的
Purple onion is sweet

200
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
# 对
Right

201
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,200
# 这个必须最后搁
The chopped purple onion has to be mixed in last

202
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
# 就是和完馅以后
Which means after everything else is mixed into the meat

203
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
# 什么时候包
When we start to put fillings into the shell

204
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
# 什么时候搁
We put the chopped onions in.

205
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,920
# 这个也不能剁
The purple onion should not be minced

206
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,160
# 必须得切
You have to cut it

207
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,880
# 就是把眼睛辣死也得切
even if the onion makes you cry

208
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
# 它一剁味就变了
If you mince it, it tastes different

209
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,400
# 好勒
OK

210
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,440
# 切这一个吧
We need one onion

211
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,320
# 对
Right

212
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,640
# 是吧
Yes

213
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
# 这葱头切的可不少
There are plenty of onions

214
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
# 来和馅
Let’s mix the fillings

215
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,280
# 算一算
Calculate to scale up or down

216
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,120
# 把这些汁均匀的渗透到肉里
Blend all the liquid into the meat

217
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,960
# 如果家里的网友就掌握不好量
If you are not sure how much liquid to add

218
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,480
# 可以自己慢慢往里注入
You can add in the liquid slowly

219
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,080
# 不要像我是一下加完开始打
Do not add everything in all at once then blend like I did

220
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,360
# 顺时针
(blend) clockwise

221
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,760
# 不要像小宋似的啊
You don’t need to do it as Xiao Song does

222
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
# 一下加足了因为他劲儿大
It is only because he has the strength to mix everything together

223
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
# 这就是一次性加完了
This is what is like if you add everything together

224
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,480
# 确实对自己来说费点劲
It is a bit difficult for me

225
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,680
# 那是
Of course

226
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,920
# 你看打馅
See how he mixes the meat filling

227
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,640
# 不停的搅
Stir with his hand constantly

228
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,560
# 跟那转速似的
His speed looks like a mixing machine!

229
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,000
# 这样
In this way,

230
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
# 它不懈
The filling can stick together

231
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,440
# 有点喘了
He is in short breath now

232
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
# 大爷您知道为什么他有点费劲吗
Do you know why he has difficulty mixing, Da Ye?

233
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,400
# 他那盆小转不开
His mixing bowl is too small

234
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
# 要不然我替你打两下
May I help you with the mixing?

235
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,560
# 别别别别别
No thanks!

236
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,720
# 我给你换一盆
Switch to a larger bowl

237
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,800
# 来放里头
Put it in

238
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,440
# 这刚才是这么顺时针打的
We mixed clockwise before

239
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
# 咱们这么一推
Pour the fillings in

240
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,120
# 还是那么顺
We should continue to stir clockwise

241
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
# 不能乱
Do not change the direction

242
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
# 这行 这行了吧
Now it’s done

243
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
# 店里全是标准化
In the restaurant, we standardize every step

244
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
# 但是在这儿咱们就得试
But here (at home) we need to try it out

245
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
# 这馅好了
The filling is done

246
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,240
# 打着粘稠有劲儿粘手
Stir until it becomes very viscous and sticky to the hand

247
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,080
# 而且你看拢到一块了
They stick together

248
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,200
# 黏在一起了
They stick together

249
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,400
# 是吧
Right

250
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
# 这洋葱加不加
Should we add the chopped onions now?

251
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,280
# 洋葱待会 什么时候包什么时候加
No, we wait until we are ready to fold the filling into the shell

252
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,280
# 开始铛馅饼
We start to preheat the baking pan and select meat pie baking mode

253
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
# 咱们定到八分钟
Let’s set for 8 minutes baking

254
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
# 八分钟开始
Hit start

255
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
# 上下铛一会就全热了
The baking pan will be ready very soon

256
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
# 这面也醒的差不多了
Now the dough has rested long enough.

257
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,800
# 这手法还挺熟的
You are very skilled!

258
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,000
# 这东西就是
There you go

259
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
# 揉完面揉润揉润以后
Knead the dough again until smooth

260
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
# 给它做成剂子条
Rub the dough into long strips

261
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,320
# 咱们揪剂子不切
We pull the dough strip into small pieces, not cutting it

262
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
# 揪的小一点
We need small pieces

263
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
# 十六克是吧
About 16 grams each piece, right?

264
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,240
# 今天您呈现的就是门丁
Today you demonstrate Doornail meat pie

265
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
# 你在大了
If the shell is bigger

266
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
# 就叫馅饼
It becomes normal meat pie

267
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
# 在大的就叫肉饼
If you make even larger shell, then it is called meatloaf pie.

268
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,040
# 下一步就来馅倒洋葱
Now we can add the chopped onion into the filling

269
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,480
# 对
Good

270
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,400
# 这会儿现包现倒洋葱啊
Only add the onion when we start making the pie.

271
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
# 现包现拌
Mix onions as we make the pie

272
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
# 因为为什么要洋葱
Why we add onions?

273
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,280
# 洋葱是跟它合在一起
We want to blend the onion in

274
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,000
# 让它融入到馅里
To mix it well into the filling

275
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,760
# 烤是为了让它融入到馅里
Baking will further mix it into the filling

276
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,640
# 葱头和牛肉是绝配
Onions pair well with beef

277
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,880
# 大爷您说的对
You are right, Da Ye

278
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,040
# 好
Nice

279
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,040
# 擀皮儿
Now we make the shell

280
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
# 这剂子可不小了
This shell is pretty big already

281
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
# 咱先包一个
Let’s try to make one first

282
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
# 包的手法
The technique we use to make the Doornail meat pie

283
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,480
# 就是老北京的那种包子的感觉
is similar to making traditional Peking style Bao Zi (steamed bun dumpling)

284
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,000
# 包包子的感觉
Feels like making Bao Zi

285
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
# 一捏褶 OK
Fold the shell like this, OK

286
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,520
# 翻过来搁
Put it aside upside down

287
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,360
# 好了
Finished

288
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
# 上盘你看看
Check on the baking pan now

289
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,480
# 淋点油
A little oil, in

290
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
# 拿刷子一刷
Brush it evenly

291
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,800
# 不要多
Not too much oil

292
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
# 烤盘一定要选深的
A deep baking pan is necessary

293
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,000
# 咱们是3.5
We use 3.5-centimeter-deep pan

294
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,680
# 其他都是2.5
Others usually use 2.5-centimeter-deep pan

295
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,560
# 进锅的时候
When we put the meat pie into the baking pan

296
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,440
# 口朝上
we put them the folding-side up

297
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,920
# 口朝上为什么呢
Why?

298
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,640
# 它底下不平
Because its bottom side is not flat yet

299
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
# 先把低下烙平
We fry it flat first

300
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,600
# 齐了
Done

301
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
# 稍微搁一会儿
We close the lid and bake for a while

302
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,880
# 不能把上面这层
You don’t want to bake the upper layer

303
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,160
# 烤老了 一烤干了
for too long. Otherwise, it is too dry.

304
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,400
# 翻过来就漏了
it will crack and leak once you turn it over

305
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
# 可以了
This is nice

306
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,280
# 上气了
Steam is coming out

307
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
# 好来了
Good

308
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,960
# 底下考焦干了
The bottom is now brown and crispy

309
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,560
# 翻盖   等一下盖盖儿
Turn the meat pie over, and bake the other side with the lid closed

310
