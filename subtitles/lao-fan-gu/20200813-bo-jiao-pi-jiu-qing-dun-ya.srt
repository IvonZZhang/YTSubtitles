134
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,320
# 还得搁点黄酒
And we need some Huangjiu rice wine

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
# 来找一个小盘给它压上点
Use a small plate to press on it

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
# 压的目的就别让这肉散了
The goal is to prevent the meat from falling apart

137

We already added spring onions and ginger. Now we should add less (of them)

142
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,720
# 全是葱姜味 也不行 一样两片
(the dish) is filled with the taste of spring onions and ginger, which is not good. A couple of slices each are sufficient.
