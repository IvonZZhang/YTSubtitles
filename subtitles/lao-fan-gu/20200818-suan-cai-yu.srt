# 对

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,440
# 大爷他们菜(国宴菜)有一个烧土豆对烧肚裆的

# 草鱼呢它有些黏液脏东西

# 把它一冲水以后就特别利索

# 知道酸菜是什么菜做的吗

# 酸菜就是榨菜大头菜

70
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
# 那上头的缨子吧那应该是

71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,160
# 我纠正一下
Let me correct that

# 广东也用这个呀
People in Guangdong also use this

74
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,200

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
# 它跟四川的盖菜还不一样
The Guangdong kales are different from the ones from Sichuan

76
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
# 它那肉特别厚
Its swollen leaf base is extra thick

77
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
# 它是长得时候叶少
But with fewer leaves

# 现在咱给它片一下因为它厚
Let’s slice the Suan Cai because it’s too thick

80
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,480
# 哎对 它更容易入味
Yeah so that the flavor comes off easier

81
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,880
# 酸菜鱼的酸菜是灵魂
Suan Cai is the soul of the Suan Cai Carp

82
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,000
# 这些酸菜就差不多了
These Suan Cai should be enough

83
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,920

# 你这酸菜差不多了

# 就是把酸菜这个臭气给它焯出去

# 这酸菜要用凉水冲一下

# 好多人就是没做这个的
A lot of people don’t know this

102
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,440
# 都直接就煸了
They skip this step and directly cook the dish

103
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,840
# 有的切完了洗吧洗吧直接就炒了
Some people just chop it, wash it and stir-fry it

104
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320

# 这时候鱼骨头该下去了

117
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,760
# 当时那鱼骨头应该稍微轻轻的炸一下
We should have fried the fish bones first

118
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280

# 把它煸出香味来

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,280
# 煸一煸它这汤容易发白

# 这叫烹调

135
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080

Now we can add the water

136
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
# 冲起来你看
The water should go over all the ingredients

137
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400

This water is a bit cool

139
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,480

# 加了温水要是开水更好
Warmer or boiling water would do a better job

141

150
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,680

That’s the second

152
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
# 吃了两片想三片
It’s so good that you would want more

153
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
# 巴适
Nice

154
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,960
# 安逸
Great

155
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
# 这时候蹲进去
Put them in a bowl

156
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
# 准备腌了开始
Let’s marinate the fish

157
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
# 盐
Salt

158
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,520
# 胡椒粉
Pepper

159
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,360
# 来点香油
Some sesame oil

160
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
# 这个味儿一定要加足了
The seasoning must be enough

161
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
# 这时候
Now

162
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
# 该鸡蛋清了
Egg whites

163
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,400
# 加蛋清起嫩
The egg whites will make the fish extra tender

164
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
# 鱼片吃到嘴里滑爽
It will be very smooth in the mouth

165
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
# 这时候不加蛋清了
Hold the egg whites now

166
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
# 先给他抓出黏度来
First mix the fish to make them sticky

167
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,320
# 对
Right

168
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,720
# 要把它胶原蛋白给它挥发出来
Mix them so that the collagen comes out

169
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
# 感觉特别黏了已经
It feels pretty sticky now

170
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
# 这时候该加蛋清了
This is when we add the egg whites

171
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
# 抓黏糊了
Mix them to coat them

172
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,080
# 开始来点玉米淀粉
Add some corn starch in there

173
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,000
# 锁住它的水分
To lock the water in the fish slices

174
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
# 其实红薯粉也可以
Sweet potato starch can also do it

175
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,160
# 红薯粉更滑
Sweet potato starch has a more creamy texture

176
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,040
# 上浆 腌制 非常好
Coating and marinating are nicely done

177
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,800
# 洗洗手
Wash your hands

178
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
# 切点小料
Mince the seasoning

179
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,720
# 这是蒜蓉跟葱花
These are garlic and green onion pieces

180
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,480
# 待会呲油的上面
Later on we’ll scald them with boiling oil

181
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
# 小葱也可以
Small green onions are also fine

182
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
# 搁了不到三斤水
I put about three pounds of water in the wok

183
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,080
# 今这个鱼大
We got a big fish today

184
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
# 这会咱们准备调味
Now let’s season the dish

185
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,440
# 赶紧调吧
Yeah do so quickly

186
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
# 准备调味了
Let’s season it

187
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,520
# 我跟大爷说的话
I was discussing it with Da Ye

188
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,240
# 一定要拿三条鲫鱼先煲汤
It’s better cook the soup with three crucian carps

189
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
# 这时候就开始加口了
Now we can adjust the saltiness of the dish

190
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,240
# 辣度都差不多了
The spiciness is almost there

191
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,480
# 这时候稍微加点盐
So let’s add some more salt

192
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
# 胡椒粉
Pepper

193
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
# 胡椒粉可以多来点儿
We can add a bit much of pepper

194
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,160
# 这差不多了
That’s about right

195
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,600
# 胡椒粉的辣
The spiciness comes from pepper

196
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
# 野山椒的辣
And the pickled peppers

197
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
# 辣度还是不够
But it’s still not enough

198
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,200
# 再加点胡椒粉
Some more pepper

199
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
# 加点白醋
And some white vinegar

200
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,640
# 让它挥发出来
Let the sourness heat off

201
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,160
# 挥发一下
Volatilize

202
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,360
# 是吧
Right

203
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,680
# 好
Nice

204
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
# 要不然你单搁这醋太愣了
Otherwise the vinegar will stand out weird

205
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
# 它愣酸愣酸的
The dish will become too weirdly sour

206
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
# 这会儿行了 把料捞出来
Now it’s ready. Get the seasoning ingredients out

207
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
# 捞干净了
Get all of them out

208
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
# 捞出来开始下鱼片
Then we can drop the fish slices

209
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
# 小点火 这都要托熟
Bring the heat down a little bit

210
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
# 火小一点儿
Turn down the burner

211
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,400
# 下入鱼片
Drop the fish slices

212
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,760
# 慢慢的用汤把浸熟 养熟
Cook them slowly with the soup

213
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,960
# 过去酸菜鱼呢
In the past, we used to cook Suan Cai Carp

214
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
# 就煮完了跟你这一样
Just like you are doing

215
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,800
# 他就不呲辣椒了
But we didn’t scald the pepper with oil at last

216
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,520
# 对
That’s right

217
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,600
# 先喝这汤
Let’s taste the soup first

218
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
# 现在江湖川菜它搁点
Now the Jianghu style Sichuan dishes have this new cooking method

219
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,840
# 搁辣椒一呲
Scald the pepper with boiling oil

220
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,360
# 好多啊这川菜它有江湖派
We use it quite often in the Jianghu style Sichuan dishes

221
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,120
# 江湖派 对
Yeah, the Jianghu style

222
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,640
# 这个白醋刚才加完了
We put some white vinegar in there

223
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,160
# 加完了就是挥发的正合适
Now it should already volatilized

224
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
# 如果说你要是想吃酸点
But if you want the dish to have a sour taste too

225
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,560
# 你可以再加点
You can add more vinegar

226
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,120
# 不想吃酸的这就可以了
If you don’t like it to be too sour, you can leave it as is

227
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
# 这时候就行了
Now it’s okay

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
# 开锅即成
Let’s get it off

229
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,880
# 出锅
Into a dish

230
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
# 喜庆
Looks so festive

231
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
# 吃一片是一片
Every slice is so good

232
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
# 呲油
Now let’s heat up some oil

233
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,360
# 这好油啊 花生油
That’s nice oil. Peanut oil

234
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
# 再来点香油
With some sesame oil

235
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
# 二合油
Mixed oil

236
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
# 这边烧着
Heat the oil there

237
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,640
# 把这辣椒稍微用水洗一下
Here we wash the pepper

238
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
# 这个时候
Now

239
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
# 蒜蓉
Garlic pieces

240
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
# 葱搁上
Green onions also on top

241
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
# 料得足
We need to put enough seasoning here

242
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,280
# 好 油锅热了啊
Alright, the oil is hot now

243
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,400
# 这休息的时候来这么一锅啊
If we can have a dish of this during day off

244
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,280
# 哎呦
Mamamia

245
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,960
# 蒜蓉给它稍微呲一下
Scald the garlic a little bit

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
# 这个时候把这辣椒
Now let’s put the peppers

247
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,000
# 搁这碗里头
In the cooking spoon

248
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
# 好这样你看
Take a look at this

249
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,360
# 稍微一呲
Scald like this

250
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
# 这辣椒
The pepper

251
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
# 说糊没糊
Is so close to being burnt but not

252
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,080
# 恰到好处 齐活
Perfectly cooked. The dish is ready

253
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
# 这酸菜鱼给师父
