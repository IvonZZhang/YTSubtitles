# 肉馅如果够咸了
If the meat is already salty enough,

94

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,320
# 经过我们打馅的过程当中
Then with more mixing,

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
# 它变成粘稠了
it will stick together again.

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,880

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,440
# 是盐激发出来的香味
It's the salt at work here

119

169
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
