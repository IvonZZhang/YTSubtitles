# 还有点儿麻麻光光的
Not too smooth

36

# 饧发好了
Once rested

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,520
# 咱们再揉揉
We will knead again

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,360
# 就是饺子面那么软硬就行了
It will be ready when it feels like dumplings dough

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,720
# 这个面已经揉了两次
I kneaded this dough twice now

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,920
# 让它特别滋润了
It is very moist now

41
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,040
# 现在就可以开始擀了
Now we can roll out the dough

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
# 我们用的是玉米淀粉
Here we are using corn starch

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,080
# 光滑
Very smooth

44
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,880
# 不容易粘
Not very sticky

45
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,800
# 咱们平常跟家里擀面条一样就行
Roll the dough out like making noodles at home

46
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,520
# 是吧
Right

47
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,840
# 咱们半斤一会就炸出来不少
The 250g of flour can make a lot of Shaqima

48
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,400
# 出数
Efficient

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,920
# 家里头都能做
We can make it at home

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,120
# 看完了师傅做这个
Look at master making it

51
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,080
# 不是您要不教家里能做的
If you don’t teach us how to make it at home

52
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,160
# 我就认为在家里永远都做不了
I don’t ever think we can make it at home

53
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
# 没有什么难的
It is not that hard

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,120
# 这回我回家可以做
Now I can make it at home

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
# 这个呢薄厚都擀匀
We should try to make the thickness consistent

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,160
# 这个就是往前推 按
The technique is to push the dough forward, then press it

57
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,480
# 往外按
Press toward the edge

58
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,600
# 连按带推 对
Push then press, right

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,120
# 其实这个面谁都会擀
Actually, everyone can roll out the dough

60
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
# 但是擀出来效果都不一样
But the outcome will be very different

61
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,600
# 你看到没有擀的薄厚一致
You see the consistency of the thickness

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
# 这是要命的
This is really difficult

63
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,520
# 折完了之后 搁上薄面
After folding them, sprinkle some more starch

64
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
# 基本上都擀完了
Pretty much finish rolling the dough now

65
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,400
# 擀完了之后咱们就切
Now we can start cutting after rolling them out

66
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,200
# 咱们切成比韭菜还得细
We can cut it thinner than chives

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
# 面点也讲究刀工
Pastry chef needs to have good knife skills too

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
# 面条精细 粗细均匀
Think noodles and consistent width

69
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
# 这个弄完了之后呢
After cutting them

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
# 我们的要求这样
We still need to do this

71
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
# 把它打开
Spread them out

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,960
# 好了你看看
Now you see they are ready

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,360
# 一边齐 行了
Line them up, all good

74
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,920
# 这一会就开炸
Later on, we start frying

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
# 这个油温不能太热
The oil temperature cannot be to high

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
# 太热一下就炸糊了
If it is too high you might burn the noodles

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
# 要做的时候我们要求
While making it, we need to use

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
# 得有两个漏勺
Need to use 2 colanders

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,360
# 就是一下炸好了同一个颜色
We need to make sure all the noodles are fried to the same color

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
# 同时捞出来
Fish them out around the same time

81
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,160
# 一个漏勺
Using one colander

82
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,840
# 有时候捞的不均匀
Sometimes it might not be enough

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
# 底下就火大了
By the time you come back for the rest they are over fried

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
# (油温)3成到4成
(Oil temperature) 90-120 Celsius now

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,480
# 你看这个往里一搁 就起来了
You just put the noodles in, they will puff up immediately

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
# 油温不能太高
The oil temperature cannot be to high

87
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
# 一进去就出锅
Pretty much fishing them out right after putting them in

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
# 你瞧瞧这底儿这个不捞
You see if I don’t pick them up in time

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,920
# 颜色就不统一了
The color will be different

90
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,000
# 所以我们就拿俩漏勺
So, we are using 2 colanders

91
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
# 让它特别一致
To make the color consistent

92
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,480
# 弄完了跟爆米花似的
Once they are finished, they look quite like popcorn

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
# 不管炸几锅
It doesn’t matter how many noodles you are frying

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,040
# 这颜色都得一样
The color needs to be consistent

95
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
# 让它洁白让它酥
It’s white and crispy

96
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
# 你瞧瞧这个炸出来了
You see these fried noodles

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
# 半斤面你瞧瞧
This is from 250g of flour

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,000
# 就那么多了一大锅了
We fried such a big wok

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
# 这个呢传统的就用青红丝
Traditionally we use colored candy strips

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,520
# 现在有好些年轻人不喜欢青红丝的话
Now younger generations don’t like the colored candy strips

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,320
# 咱们可以买点儿果脯 红的绿的黄的
We can use the dry fruits, red green yellow fruits

102
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
# 切成小粒撒上
We chop them finely and sprinkle them on

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
# 也OK了
That’s okay too

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
# 我们把青红丝再揽两刀
Now we roughly cut the colored candy strips

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,080
# 不用那么长 为的点缀
We don’t need them to be that long, just garnish

106
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,960
# 开火
Turn on the stove

107
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
# 这个搁60克的水
We add 60g of water

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
# 搁175克的糖
Add 175g of sugar

109
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,920
# 我们熬糖稀
Now we are making syrup

110
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,280
# 小火熬着
Heating it with low heat

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
# 把这个糖充分熬化
Cook the sugar thoroughly and melt it

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
# 不能来回和了
You can keep mixing it

113
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,520
# 老和了一翻沙 就完蛋了
Mixing it too often will make crystalized sugar, then it doesn’t work

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
# 这特别烫 糖
This is very hot, the sugar

115
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
# 我们起边上沾一点
We get some sugar from the edge

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,200
# 这个没有丝
It doesn’t stretch

117
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,080
# 待一会就有丝了
Later on, you can stretch the syrup

118
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,480
# 汤汁也发亮了
When the syrup is shiny

119
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,440
# 对熬亮了
Yes, wait until it’s shiny

120
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,200
# 这时候呢
Now

121
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,240
# 我们把75克的蜂蜜倒进去
We are adding 75g of honey

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
# 小火熬着
Keep the low heat

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
# 这时候我回过来
Now I turn to the board

124
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,560
# 把案板上搁几粒芝麻 熟芝麻
Sprinkle some sesame onto the board, cooked sesame

125
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
# 这个基本上差不多了
Now it’s almost done

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,760
# 一定不能拿手指进去 进去就烫坏了
You can dip you finger in there, you might burn yourself

127
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,560
# 你看看这个
You see grab some from here

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,920
# 成丝了
You can stretch the syrup now

129
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,840
# 红了
It’s red

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,200
# 关上了 完了之后
Turn off the heat, once turning off the heat

131
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,720
# 你看这个啊我们均匀的撒上
You see we need to pour it over evenly

132
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,640
# 快点搅拌(不搅拌)成坨了
And mix them well quickly, otherwise it will stick together and hard to shape

133
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
# 均匀的搅拌
Mix them well

134
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,720
# 二伯您这责任可重大啊
Er Bai you have very important responsibility

135
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,840
# 嘿

# OK了

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
# 倒这上头就行了
You can pour them on this

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,360
# 嘿 真地道嘿
Ha, looks authentic

139
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,600
# 大概齐给它弄个长方形的
Shape it into a rectangular

140
