# import intro

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
# 恨不得就是直接从鸡圈里面
If I can, I would actually just grab a chicken from the yard

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,680
# 或者是从散养的鸡里面
Or from the free-range fields.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,720
# 抓一只鸡来煮
And cook it as fresh as possible

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,440

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,240
# 煮完之后就拌
Boil it and prepare this dish

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,640
# 一下就激发出来了 但不能多了
The flavours are coming out, but don’t over-do it

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,360
# 在我们乐山 我们从小到大
In Le Shan, we grew up with this dish

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,720
# 好多年好多年好多年的
Year by year

9
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,920
# 椒麻鸡
Jiao Ma Chicken (Spicy chicken with Sichuan Pepper)

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,960
# 我这个鸡 它要开水下锅
We need to cook it with boiling water

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,400
# 放点姜片 放点大葱
Ginger and spring onion

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,040
# 放一点白芷 放一点花椒
A bit of Baizhi (Angelica dahurica) and Sichuan Pepper

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,400
# 白芷是杀菌 然后增加肉香的
Baizhi helps to improve the flavour of the meat

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
# 花椒是去腥的
Sichuan pepper removes the gamey tastes

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,400
# 然后放一点黄酒 这个不能放太多了
A bit of the Huangjiu rice wine, not too much

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
# 然后这个鸡我稍微处理一下
Let me prepare this chicken

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,400
# 你可以整只的煮
You can boil the whole chicken

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,720
# 也可以从中间劈开
You can also cut it open from the middle

20
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,760
# 你的小鸡挺嫩啊
This chicken is quite tender

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,640
# 采用的是散养的这种小公鸡
Yes, it’s a free-ranged rooster

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
# 这样的肉质 它会比较结实
The meat is quite firm

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,040
# 口感才会比较好一点 这样劈开
And it will taste better. Let’s open it up like this

24
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,240
# 然后下鸡有一个讲究
There is a tip in boiling the chicken

25
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,600
# 三上三下
You first dip it in and out three times like this

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,720
# 先过一下把皮紧一下
To firm-up the skin

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,320
# 然后这样再下去
Then you put it in the water

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,080
# 一个是能够去掉它的腥味
This removes the gamey flavour

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,800
# 再一个使它皮紧实 待会煮出来好一点
Also the skin will stay firm after boiling

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,280
# 好了 现在做一个非常关键的东西
Now, we work on something very important.

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
# 椒麻鸡么 其实在于椒麻
The key to this dish, is the Chili and Sichuan peppers

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,880
# 藤椒
Tenjiao Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum armatum)

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
# 特别在我们乐山老家
This is popular in my hometown Le Shan

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
# 家家户户门口都会有一两棵树
Everyone will grow one or two trees outside their house, 

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,800
# 从树上摘下来 安逸
You go and pick it when you are cooking. Very nice.

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,880
# 这个很简单
This is simple

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,920
# 花椒它表皮富含油包
The pericarp is rich in oil content

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,720
# 我们需要把油稍微烧热一点点 菜籽油
We just need to heat up a bit of rapeseed oil

39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,200
# 不要烧的太过了
Don’t over-cook it

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,920
# 这个菜为什么叫椒麻鸡 就跟这个有关
This is how the dish gets its name

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,400
# 这个菜籽油有两种说法
About the rapeseed oil, there’s some debate about it

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,440
# 一个是要把它炼到冒青烟
Some say you need to heat it up until it smokes

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,400
# 然后让它过了 没有菜籽油的味道
Let the smoke run out to get rid of the excess smell

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,720
# 其实不然 一定要刚好冒烟
Actually, that’s not totally true. We only need to heat till it just starts to smoke.

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,160
# 能闻到菜籽油的香味的时候
The moment when you start to smell it

46
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,400
# 现在已经闻到了
Like now.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,280
# 有味道是吧 刚好冒烟 咱就可以了
Do you smell it? And it’s just starting to smoke, that’s it.

48
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,720
# 这个香味刚刚好
Perfect timing.

49
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,120

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,200
# 如果你油温太高就炸枯了
Over-heating the oil will dry out the Sichuan pepper

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
# 这道菜的关键
The key to this dish

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
# 是对油的把控 和温度的把控
Is to get the oil and temperature correct

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,760
# 我们把这个先放一边
Let’s put it aside

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,680
# 然后来一个更关键的
Another key point

55
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,800
# 我们做一个红油
Is the red chili oil

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,920
# 红油这个辣椒特别有讲究
The choice of chili peppers is important

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
# 四川二荆条
We use the “Erjingtiao” chili pepper from Sichuan

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,400
# 既有颜色 又有香味 然后还有辣味
It’s got the color, the aroma and the hotness

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
# 二荆条我放点芝麻
We also need a bit of sesame

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,000
# 然后这个时候加点生油 生的菜籽油
Let’s mix it up with some raw rapeseed oil

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,160
# 叫它拌一拌 它不至于糊了
It prevents the chili pepper from burning

62
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,480
# 一个是不至于糊了
That’s one

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,600
# 一个是它待会有生菜籽油的香味
It also adds a layer of the raw rapeseed aroma

64
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,880
# 好了油温也上来了
Alright the oil is heated up

65
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,800

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,960
# 炸的颜色变黄
Keep frying until it turns yellow

68
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,600
# 这个时候我放一点香料
Now let’s put the spices in

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,320
# 八角 这几个香料是增加油的香味

# 桂皮 白蔻 三奈 香叶 小茴香

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,320

Why now ?

72
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,600
# 因为葱炸出来之后
Because you don’t want to over-cook the spices

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
# 这个香料它不要炸的太过

# 你看香料的综合的香味出来了
You can smell the complex aroma from all of the spices

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,360
# 我现在要把它温度降一降
We need to lower the temperature a bit

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,880
# 温度太高了 辣椒面要糊了
Otherwise it will burn the chili flakes

78
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,440
# 先试第一遍 看它的热度怎么样
Let’s give it a test see if it’s hot enough

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,960
# 如果热度不够 然后增加它的热度
If not, then we can bring the heat up.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,720
# 热度差点 再稍微提一点温度
It’s not hot enough.

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,120
# 其实第一次把它和匀了之后
It’s fine to mix it up first

82
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,280
# 把温度烧上来 呲啦一下去
And then pour some hot oil afterwards

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,280
# （篦出小料）这样出来辣椒面更漂亮一点
Use the sieve to remove the spices

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
# 好 这个温度绝对可以了
OK we it’s good enough now

85
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,400
# 放完油之后不要动它
Don’t move it, let it sit

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,160
# 动了之后的辣椒面
If you do

87
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,840
# 跟它最后沉淀的香味是不一样的
The flavour and aroma will be affected.

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,280

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,920
# 你看这个 是不是有白芷的香味

# 但泡要泡十几分钟

# 然后冰水拔完了之后 稍微拿出来晾一晾
After that, let it drain a bit

104

# 要不它水汽太重 改一下刀

Keep the parts intact

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
# 包括鸡爪子都很好吃的

# 吃鸡一定要啃着鸡骨头吃 越啃越香
Chicken tastes much better with the bones.

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
# 而且鸡骨头还能吸味

# 我这切了点大葱丁
Here are some spring onion.

110

112
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
# 加一点味精
A little bit of MSG

113
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,840
# 这个味精不要多了 因为鸡肉比较鲜
Not too much as the chicken already has a lot of umami flavour.

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,480
# 我要放一点酱油
A bit of soy sauce

115
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,480
# 黄豆酱油一个是能拔色 一个能提鲜

# 刚才不是搞了这么多香料
We used so many spices

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,080
# 整得这么复杂的红油
To make such a complicated chili oil

121
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,760
# 香味非常的香
The aroma is amazing

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,760
# 而且是现烫的红油才是最香的
The best is to make the chili oil on spot

123
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,480
# 如果你提前烫放那
If you make it too early in advance

124
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
# 它就没有那个感觉了
It doesn’t taste as good.

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,160
# 现烫的花椒油 现烫的红油 特别香
Freshly made Sichuan pepper oil and chili pepper oil are the best

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,640
# 稍微给重一点
We can use a bit more of this

129
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,440
# 为什么川菜吃了香
Why does Sichuan food taste so good?

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,200
# 它一般的油都比较大
They are bold with using oil

131
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
# 没有油气它就不香
You need sufficient oil to bring out the flavour

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
# 这个时候我还要加一点点的原汤
Now, we need a bit of the chicken stock

133
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,840
# 原汤来一点 不要多了
Just a little bit, not too much

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,960
# 让它能够把调料给化一下

137
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,240
# 还差一点白糖 增加它的鲜味
We also need a bit of sugar to intensify the taste

138
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
# 第二个是中和
It makes the spices a bit milder

139
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,280
# 第三个稍微有一点增香和去腥
It also improves the aroma and removes any unwanted taste

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
# 好了温温的
Alright, it’s still warm

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,640
# 然后这个时候我再放一点小米辣
Lastly, some fresh “Xiaomila” chili pepper

142
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
# 这个时候放花椒粉
Grounded Sichuan pepper

143
