Meat Eater Feng, I can’t just serve you meat

I’ll cook a flatfish for you today, which is a butterfish

# 你知道北方人啊吃鱼比较笨

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,960
# 怕刺多 所以这个鱼就一条刺
They are afraid of the bones. But this fish has only one large bone

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,040
# 这一夹就一块一块 对没错
You pull the fish meat off the bone. Yes, you are right

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,480
# 过去我们北方这一带
In the past, around this area in the North

# 就是平鱼 带鱼 黄花鱼

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,800
# 怎么打刀呢 就是井字刀呗
How to score the fish? Crosscut

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,000

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
# 这边是这样
On the other side, score it like this

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,960

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,200
# 知道了吧 它不是两面全是井字
You see, it’s not crosscut on both sides

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
# 一面柳一面井
One side crosscut, the other side parallel

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,400
# 哪面朝上 十字朝上
Which side faces up? The crosscut one

27

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,080
# 因为它要的是汁儿 这是进底味

# 这才叫肉 它香啊
This is what I call MEAT, because it’s so aromatic

38

# 我给你多搁点肉吧

# 其实按正常来说有这一片就够了

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,560
# 咱们多来点 一定带皮
Let’s have some more today. Leave the skin on

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,120
# 您少吃（肉）多吃鱼让您
You shall eat less pork and more fish

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,360
# 我少吃鱼多吃肉啊
And I’ll eat less fish and more pork

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,720

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
# 这肉还真不少 不错不错

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,240
# 然后咱们今天应该有点笋
Then we should have bamboo shoots today

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
# 他买的笋丝
He bought these bamboo shoots

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,560
# 但是咱们意思意思啊 借借味
Just a little bit, to add some extra flavours

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
# 这就行了
That’s it

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
# 点火烧油 炸鱼
Wok on, oil in, heat up, let’s fry the fish

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,360
# 这鱼一定拿纸给擦干
Make sure you pat dry the fish

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,280
# 省的崩着你 直接炸
The oil may splatter if just deep-frying the wet fish

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,320
# 那咱用油煎也行啊 煎可以啊
We can also pan fry it. Yes, you can

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,760
# 但是按正规来说是炸
But the best way is deep frying

61
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,280
# 一过油它香啊
It will be extra aromatic after deep frying

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,760
# 你知道炸鱼的油面怎么看吗
Do you know how to check if the oil is ready for frying?

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,680
# 你看轻轻的翻滚的时候
When the surface is slightly bubbling

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
# 它这油温就合适了
It has the right temperature

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
# 基本上就在七成了
It’s around 70% hot

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,960
# 可以了
There we go

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880

68
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,320
# 炸成这样就行了
Fry it until it looks like this

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,000
# 能翻个面咱瞧瞧那面么
Could we see the other side?

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
# 两面金黄
Golden on both sides

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,440
# 好 空油
Alright, take it out

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,600
# 先下什么 下肥肉膘
What do we add in first? Fatty pork

74
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,280

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,840
# 这个菜（煸炒的时候）
When stir frying this

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,680
# 不要搁大料 也不搁花椒
Don’t add any star anise or Sichuan peppercorns

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,320
# 红烧是搁花椒大料 干辣椒肉片
You add Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, dried chilli and pork slices when you braise things in soy sauce

78
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,800
# 这是川菜的干烧
But this is dry braising in Sichuan Cuisine

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,560
# 干烧不需要 对
Dry braising doesn’t need those ingredients. Yes

80
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,600
# 你看 炒出油来
Look, render out the fat

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
# 搁一点甜面酱
Put in a little bit Tian Mian Jiang (sweet bean paste)

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,120

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
# 完了之后 搁豆瓣酱
Followed by some Dou Ban Jiang (spicy broad bean paste)

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,440

85
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,480
# 小火慢炒 放小料头
Sauté with low heat, and throw in all the minor ingredients

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,760

87
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,800
# 姜蒜笋香菇 煸炒
Ginger, garlic, bamboo shoots and shiitake mushrooms. Stir fry them

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
# 黄酒
Some cooking wine

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,880

90
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,320
# 酱油
Soy sauce

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,920

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
# 这是借酱油的味 你看
It’s for the extra layer of flavour

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,280
# 因为它有酱 有豆瓣酱
It already has the sauce, Dou Ban Jiang

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
# 咸度基本上差不多了
So it has enough salt in there

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,160
# 糖
Some sugar

96
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,840
# 看到没有 你看这汁黏不黏
Now you can see, is the sauce viscous?

97
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,560
# 烧出来以后就这样
It will look like this after braising

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,840
# 这干嘛 搁一点水
What’s next, pour in some water

99
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,760
# 有很多人做干烧都要勾芡
A lot of people add slurry when dry braising

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
# 这种是错误的 就不能勾芡
That’s wrong. You can’t add slurry

101
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,000
# 干烧是自然收汁 对
Dry braising is reducing the sauce down naturally. Yes

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,760
# 醋 三叔做菜醋的量是比较大的
Some Vinegar. San Shu, you always use generous amounts of vinegar in your dishes

103
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
# 我是拿的比较准的
I know the exact amount I need

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,880
# 给一点点盐 不给盐它不香
Season it with some salt, otherwise it won’t be as aromatic

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,080
# 看这颜色怎么样 可以
What do you think of the colour? Amazing

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,640
# 这个时候就把鱼下下去了
Now, bring the fish back in the sauce

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320

108
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,080
# 川菜的特点是什么
What’s one of the characteristics of Sichuan Cuisine?

109
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
# 葱出锅搁
You sprinkle some spring onions after the cooking is done

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280

111
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,800
# 那就是咱们这所说倒炝呗
This is what we call ‘reverse cooking’

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
# 倒炝 倒烹
Yes, reverse cooking

113
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,560
# 一定是甜辣咸酸 这叫干烧
When it has sweetness, spiciness, saltiness and sourness well mixed and combined, this is called a decent dry braising dish.

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,360
# 在家能烧一条好鱼来
To cook a delicious fish dish at home

115
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
# 得需要工夫
It takes time.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
# 一是要工夫  需要心细
And attention to details

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
# 做完以后你有成就感
When it’s done, you will be rewarded with the sense of achievement

118
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
# 你像咱们做这么多年了
After so many years of being professional chefs like us

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,440
# 每次一道菜如果出来成品特别好
Every time we cook a fantastic dish

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,200
# 心里也舒服
We feel so accomplished

121
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,720
# 有很多人就不知道往里头放甜面酱
Many people don’t know the secret of adding Tian Mian Jiang

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
# 包括咱们炒回锅肉
When cooking Sichuan Cuisine including the double-cooked pork

123
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
# 都要给点甜面酱
We all need to add some Tian Mian Jiang

124
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,800
# 它出来那个酱 最后发稠
It makes the finished sauce viscous

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,920
# 收汁的时候它拿酱收汁
It helps with the sauce reduction

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,280

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
# 有酱香的气味
And it adds some aroma

128
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,880
# 你说这么多料搁进去能不好吃吗
It’s impossible to make the fish not tasty after you put in so many ingredients

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
# 南方人不理解
Southern people don’t understand

130
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,160
# 说你们炖条鱼四十分钟鲜味没了
They say all the umami in the fish would have gone after 40 minutes of braising

131
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
# 其实我们很鲜
In fact, it will be super umami

132
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,440
# 鱼鲜 原材料好 怎么做都好吃
When the fish and other ingredients are all fresh and in great quality, the dish will always come out tasty however way you cook it

133
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,240
# 多㸆一会 有锅盖
Braise it for some extra time. We have the lid

134
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
# 干烧鱼不能盖盖
You can’t use a lid when dry braising

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
# （一盖盖）鱼皮和肉脱开了
Otherwise, the fish skin would come off the flesh

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
# 显得特别没精神 懒呼呼的
The fish would look drowsy and lazy

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,440
# 这跟一宿没睡觉似的
It would look like it hadn’t slept all night

138
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,760
# 一定是敞开小火慢炖
So dry braising must be lid free on low heat

139
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,800
# 这知识点知道了吧 知道了
Remember this tip. Got it

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
# 这个鱼烧完以后
Once cooking is done

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
# 有醋香味没有醋酸味
The fish will have the aroma from the vinegar, but it won’t taste acidic

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,480
# 为什么那么早搁醋
That’s why we added the vinegar that early

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,120
# 这个油得比正常烧鱼要稍微厚一点
We use slightly more oil than we normally would when cooking a fish

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
# 就是经常讲么
There is a saying

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
# 中餐没有油不好吃
Chinese Cuisine wouldn’t taste as good without the oil

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
# 这待会要拌点米饭 神了
Mix it with some rice in a minute. That’s fantastic

147
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,640
# 你看现在能看出来了
Now you can see

148
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,920
# 这有粘稠度没有 哪来的
Is there viscosity in the sauce? Where does it come from?

149
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,440
# 这就是酱里边来的 对甜面酱
It comes from the Tian Mian Jiang

150
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
# 粘稠度开始收
It will become even more viscous

151
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,320
# 如果你要不搁甜面酱
If you didn’t add Tian Mian Jiang

152
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,680
# 它没有这么黏
It wouldn’t be as viscous

153
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,200
# 噗嗤噗嗤小火慢收
Reduce the sauce down with very low heat

154
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,480
# 你像这火都属于大
The heat now is still too high for what is needed here

155
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,320

156
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
# 应该还小
It should turn down even lower

157
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,120
# 这鱼绝对到时候漂亮
This fish must be very beautiful once done

158
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
# 多棒这汁
How gorgeous is this sauce!

160
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,760
# 黏不黏 你勾什么芡啊
How viscous! No need of any slurry

161
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,320
# 这不是快速的东西
This is not fast food

162
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,920
# 烧就有过程的
Braising takes time

163
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,280
# 老饭骨做饭一定不能含糊
Lao Fan Gu always take cooking very seriously

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
# 真家伙摆出来
We show you the real deal

165
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,000
# 你看现在基本上差不多了
Now, it’s getting there

166
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,920
# 收的还是可以的吧
The sauce is perfectly reduced

167
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,440
# 咱们现在就可以出锅了
We can take it out of the wok now

168
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
# 最后炝葱花
Lastly, sprinkle some spring onions

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
# 咱们灭火
Heat off

170
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:46,360

171
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,760
# 不破其型
Don’t break the fish

172
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,320
# 老饭骨还是那句话
It’s still that saying from Lao Fan Gu

173
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,280
# 做菜就不能马虎 就不能含糊
Cooking is serious, you can’t cut corner

174
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,600
# 一定要有油
There must be some oil

175
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
# 这道菜我一定要学会
I need to learn this dish

176
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
# 做出来要有味道 层次感要强
The dish must have the layers and complexity of flavours

177
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,240
