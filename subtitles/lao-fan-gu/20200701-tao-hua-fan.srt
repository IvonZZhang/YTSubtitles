# 蒸好以后别晾的太凉
After steaming, don't cool it down for too long

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,320

It should still be warm. Otherwise the rice won't stick together

# 直接按在电饼铛上
Press the rice on the baking pan

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,920
# 盖盖儿的时候烤一下

00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,200
# 在家烤了一个 用我们家的电饼铛

# 我们这烤箱已经预热了 两百三十度

# 胡萝卜改刀 切成虾仁状的片
Cut the carrots into 'shrimp-like' slices

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,800
# 没有青豆可以用点黄瓜
If you don't have green pea, you can use cucumber instead

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,240
# 这几块够了 一会一块给它煮一下

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,320
# 我这个上浆就比较快
The way I'm showing is a fast one

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,400

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
# 料酒要么大爷 现在不要

For example, if we are going to 'jiang' (coat food with batter) shredded fish or chicken

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
# 你搁了淀粉 搁盐 搁了盐搁蛋清
Normally, we add starch, salt, and egg white to the food

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,920
# 要抓拌三回到四回 容易断
We need to mix it 3 or 4 times. The food will be broken

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,720
# 就把这鸡丝鱼丝给抓断了
The shredded chicken or fish will be broken into pieces

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
# 这是最快速的上浆方法
This is the fastest way of 'jiang' (coat food with batter)

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,800
# 抓拌以后这一定要上劲儿
You should keep stir-mixing until it becomes tough

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,640
# 干活手底下要利索 守门
-While cooking, you should do everything neatly. -That's 'guard the door'

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
# 来点油 好了
Add some oil. That's enough

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,040
# 这时候我们再把它抓一下 就不容易干
Now mix it again so that it doesn't dry easily

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,480
# 下锅炒的时候也容易散开
Also, the shrimps won't clump up while stir-frying

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,600
# 看看这锅巴 现在放放气 再烤会
Take a look at the rice. Now release the steam and bake it for a while again

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,880

-Blanch the vegetables. -It's done as soon as the water starts boiling

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,840
# 这锅巴掰碎一点 也别太碎
Break the rice crust into small pieces, but not too small

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,240
# 掰几块 十块 一人一块
How many pieces? Ten. One piece per person

-Master, you are here. -Da Ye is making nice rice crust here!

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,400

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,320
# 炝锅 来点水
Stir-fry the green onion, ginger, and garlic first. Add some water

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,960
# 番茄酱要比番茄沙司要好
Tomato sauce is better than ketchup

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,280
# 它就是番茄酱的本味
It provides the original taste of tomato

84
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,680
# 炒一炒 炒的颜色更加红润
Stir-fry it. The color becomes more red

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,800
# 用水激一下
Add some cold water

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,480
# 再来一碗水 这是个烩菜
One more bowl of water. This is a 'stewed dish'

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
# 汤汁多一点 照着一碗（水）
There should be more sauce, like a bowl (of water)

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,320
# 这个汁我们现在 颜色已经够了
The sauce is now at the right color

89
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,240
# 把这料放进去
Now add these ingredients

90
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,920
# 黄酒 做虾酒要少 不要太多 不鲜了
-Huangjiu rice wine. Less when cooking shrimps, don't add too much. -Otherwise the shrimp will lose its savory taste

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,960
# 可以坐上油了 放糖
-We can start heating the oil. -Add sugar

92
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,680
# 糖要多一点 甜酸 小糖醋味
Add more sugar. This dish should taste 'sweet-sour'

93
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
# 白胡椒粉 小甜酸
-White ground pepper. -'Light sweet-sour'

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,760
# 要想甜要加盐
If you want to emphasize the sweetness, add some salt

95
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,160

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
# 淀粉加水 水淀粉
Add some starch to water. -'Water starch'

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
# 这时候把这味定好
Now let's set the flavor

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,800
# 糖是什么 这个汁一亮 就说明这糖够了
One thing about sugar... When the sauce becomes shiny, it means there's enough sugar

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,560
# 现在这白糖也有一个缺点
But the sugar nowadays has a shortcoming

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,080
# 有的网友说 大爷搁盐搁那么多
Some friends complained like 'Da Ye added too much salt!'

101
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,200
# 盐不咸 糖现在也不甜
Now the salt is not salty enough. Sugar is not as sweet as in the past, either

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,160
# 搁点白醋 白醋它的酸性比较稳
Add some white vinegar. White vinegar has a stable sour taste

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,800
# 搁米醋一下锅这味就跑了 酸度不稳
If you use rice vinegar, the sour taste will be gone as soon as you add it into the wok. It's not stable

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,480
# 这味儿搁好了 先关火
The flavor is Ok. Now turn off the heat first

105
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,360
# 现在我先把虾仁滑出来
Now let me fry the shrimp first

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,360
# 五成热 因为咱们家里火慢
Use 50% hot oil (150 degrees Celcius). The heat is not powerful at home

107
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,760
# 所以油温稍微的高一点
So we use a slightly higher temperature

108
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,280
# 你看这倍儿漂亮
See? This is so beautiful

109
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,640
# 我把虾仁弄完了捞出去
I'm taking out the shrimp

110
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,400
# 接着倒油 炸锅巴 颜色真鲜亮
-Then add some oil and fry the rice crust. -The color is so bright and shiny

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
# 然后我们就开始勾芡了
Then we start thickening the sauce

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,520

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,280
# 拿出来看看这个锅巴
Let's take a look at the rice crust

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,480

115
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,240
# 再烤烤 烤完了出来晾着
Bake it for more time. Then take it out and chill it outside

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,240
# 大爷行啊自己烤锅巴
Da Ye, you're great. You bake the rice crust yourself?

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,560
# 油热了 高一点 要达到六成
The oil is hot. It should be hotter, like 60% hot (180 degrees Celcius)

118
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,840
# 你看锅巴一会啪就胀起来了
Look. The rice crust is swelling up soon

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,160
# 炸到金黄色
Fry it until golden yellow

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,720

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
# 看着啊
Look!

122
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,920

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,440
# 这叫桃花泛
This is 'Tao Hua Fan' (Floating peach blossom)

124
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,840
# 你看像不像盛开的桃花 一朵一朵的
See? It's like peach blossoms. Many blossoms

125
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,520
# 二伯 大爷我刚才偷懒回来晚点
-Er Bai. -Da Ye, sorry for coming late

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,560
# 又赶上吃了
But just the time to eat

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,600
# 刚强 来着
Gang Qiang, take this

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,440
# 真够嫩 你听
-So tender. -Listen

130
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,600
# 现在这个味道正好 汁完全都浸透了
Now the flavor is just right. The sauce fully penetrates (into the rice crust)

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,560
# 现在都倍儿脆
It's still extra crispy

133
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,640

134
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,560
# 锅巴太脆了 香
The rice crust is so crispy. Delicious!

135
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,760

136
