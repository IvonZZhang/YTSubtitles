# State Banquet Master Chefs - Spicy fried oyster mushroom with fried Mantou

# 简介

# 小友们好！大师姐又给大家带来简单家常的小菜咯，这道菜名叫赛鸡枞菌！
# Hello friends, Da Shi Jie is coming with another easy recipe for you to cook at home. The dish is called Sai Ji Zong Jun(As good as termite mushroom).
# 鸡枞菌188一斤，咱们用平菇来做，成本就十来块，干香酥脆，味道可一点不比鸡枞菌差！喜欢吃辣的小友也可以加小米椒，辣味十足！大爷两个小米椒吃进去，被辣得满头大汗😥
# Termite mushroom is usually 188 CNY for 1 jin (0.5 kg), but we can replace it with oyster mushroom, and the cost comes down to 10 CNY. Once cooked, oyster mushroom is fragrant, crispy, crunchy, and tastes as good as termite mushroom. You can also add "Xiaomila" chili pepper if you love the spicy food. Da Ye had two pieces of "Xiaomila", and was sweating non-stop😥.
# 炸馒头的做法也是精髓，按照大师姐方法来做的炸馒头，金黄酥脆还不吸油不掉渣，小友们一定要学起来！
# The way to fry mantou is also something to look out for. If you follow Da Shi Jie's recipe, the fried mantou will be golden, crispy, won’t retain excessive oil or crumble. It is a must try!
# 片尾大爷还有个小绝招要教大家：如何炒素菜保持蔬菜营养不流失、颜色翠绿？
# At the end of the video, Da Ye will also teach everyone a special trick to preserve the color and nutrients when cooking leafy green vegetables.

# 这个油咱是可以留出来备用的

# 用这菌菇油都特别香
The mushroom oil will bring out a unique aroma

30

# 用别的菇行不行
Can I use other types of mushroom?

32

# 杏鲍菇咱们做的时候
Make sure to steam the king oyster mushroom first

# 油温啊 五成热
Oil temperature is about 150C

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,040
# 你看蘑菇一炸香味出来
I can smell the aroma as soon as the mushroom goes in the oil

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,480
# 家里的火是大火
Make sure you are on high heat if you are at home

48
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,080
# 酒店的火是小火
and on low heat if you are cooking at a restaurant

49
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,400
# 别怕吃油这个蘑菇炸完以后费不了多少油
Don't afraid of adding too much oil, the mushroom won't soak up that much

50
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,440
# 炸焦吗
Do you fry until the moisture is gone?

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,120
# 那你捞出来
Then why are you taking it out?

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
# 捞出来让油温升高再炸
Scoop it out so that the oil is a bit hotter

53
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
# 他们卖凉菜的
The people who sell cold dishes

54
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,040

# 给它把水分炸出去的
Fry all the moisture out of the mushroom

56
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,360

After it is fried. It tastes amazing.

# 肯定好吃
I can imagine

59
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
# 再炸俩馒头片
Now let's fry a couple slices of Mantou

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,680
# 这个菌油啊炸馒头片贼香
Use the mushroom oil to fry the Mantou slices for the mushroom aroma

61
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,120
# 菌油馒头片 你知道吗
Have you heard of mushroom infused oil fried Mantou slices?

# 把这个蘑菇丝给它炸干了
Fry the mushroom shreds until dry

63
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
# 这差不多了
That looks pretty good

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
# 为什么要炸干呢
Why do you have to fry it till dry?

65
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,880
# 他这个香味就出来了
To bring out the aroma

66
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,040
# 她做完了
Now she's done

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,880
# 您看外形可能烧完跟鸡枞菌一模一样
It looks identical to termite mushroom!

68
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,920
# 他不炸焦了还真不好吃
The taste will be subpar if you don't fry it till dry

69
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,760
# 就跟炸肉丝似的
Almost like frying slices of meat

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,640
# 对
Yea

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,840
# 咱们锅里倒点油
Now let's add some oil into the wok

# 咱们把这葱姜倒里面
In goes the green onion and ginger

74
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
# 煸一下 煸炒
Cook the aroma out a bit

75
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
# 炸点葱油
Make some scallion oil

76
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,800
# 咱们把这个葱就挑出去了
And let's take the green onions out

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,440
# 咱们搁点酱油
Now some soy sauce in

78
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
# 酱油爆锅
make sure it is bubbling

79
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,480
# 来一点点老抽
Some dark soy sauce

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,280
# 白糖
Sugar

81
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,200
# 够了
That's enough

82
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
# 再炒一下
Mix it well

83
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,920
# 好了
Good

84
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,200
# 咱们把芝麻打进去
Now let's mix the sesame seeds in it

85
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,520
# 师父来了啊
Master's turn now.

86
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
# 小米辣进来
Here is the Xiaomila peppers

87
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,480
# OK

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
# 关火了
Turn off the heat

89
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,560
# 太棒了
WOW

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,320
# 大爷您看看
Look at this Da Ye!

91
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,440
# 这个菜像干煸牛肉丝
This dish is very similar to dry cooked beef slices

92
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
# 过去讲话就小馒头墩儿
Back in the days, we would call this a little Mantou pile

93
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,960
# 大爷您看咱们这油啊
Da Ye, look at this oil

94
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
# 刚才炸蘑菇的
that we just fried the mushroom in

95
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,760
# 咱们把它给大家炸一个馒头片
Now let's fry the Mantou slices

96
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,520
# 咱馒头也准备好了
Here is the Mantou

97
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,720
# 一定要使这凉馒头
Make sure to use cold Mantou

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
# 它这样切起来比较整齐
So that it cuts nicely

99
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
# 完了以后把渣抖一下
Shake any crumbs off

100
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
# 这样的话
So that

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,040
# 省的渣子到油里边
The crumbs won't leave in the oil

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,240
# 脏锅
and make it dirty
103
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,800
# 这就是细节
It’s all in the details

104
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,880
# 您看今天我炸这馒头
Today let's fry the Mantou

105
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,680
# 给大家带一小窍门
with a little trick

106
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,760
# 清水半斤的清水
Water 0.5 jin (250g)

107
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
# 加一勺盐有5克
salt 5g

108
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,600
# 然后咱们加80克的淀粉
then 80g of corn starch

109
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
# 这种炸法我还是头一次看到
I've never seen this way of frying before

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
# 这馒头就不容易吃油了
If you cook it this way, Mantou won't soak up the oil

111
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,920
# 炸出来就比较酥脆
and the final product will be very crispy

112
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
# 咱们这油锅也差不多
The oil seems ready

113
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,760
# 馒头片到里边蘸一下
Quickly dip the Mantou slices in the starch mixture

114
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
# 就可以了
That's it

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,480
# 现在(油温)有6成
The oil temperature is about 180C

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
# 动作得快
Make sure to act quickly

117
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,560
# 而且呢外焦里嫩
And it will be crispy on the outside soft on the inside.

118
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,960
# 加上玉米淀粉呢一炸它就定型了
Adding the corn starch will help stabilizing its shape

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
# 定型这个油呢就不会往馒头里边去了
Once it is shaped, the oil won't go into the Mantou slices

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
# 还不会上色
And won't brown the slices

121
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
# 而且咱们这馒头
Also make sure the Mantou

122
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
# 千万不能是刚蒸出来
we are frying

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
# 咱就直接来炸馒头片
is not fresh out of the steamer

124
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,200
# 那种的
Those Mantou

125
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
# 它是第一掉渣
will leave lots of crumbs in the oil,

126
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,760
# 第二它不容易成型
take longer to shape,

127
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,640
# 第三是吸油
and soak up a lot of oil

128
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
# 诶 差不多了
Looks like it is ready

129
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
# 炸成金黄
Fry until golden brown

130
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
# 咱们搁这上吸油
Leave it on the kitchen towel to soak out the excessive oil

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
# 也不掉渣儿
There is no crumbs at all

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
# 尝尝啊
Let's give it a try

133
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,560
# 看看这样吃我的辣椒
Look at the chilies

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,520
# 辣椒可吃不下
I can't take any chilies at all

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
# 大爷我给您先来一块儿
I will prepare a piece for you first Da Ye

136
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,320
# 师父
Master

137
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,360
# 你看看 这鸡枞菌
Look at this "termite mushroom"

138
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,200
# 怎么样
How is it?

139
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
# 馒头脆吧
Is the Mantou crispy?

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
# 馒头够酥
Mantou is so good

141
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
# 如果说不喜欢吃干香的

# 他这个半盆菜
It will be half a bowl

216
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,840

The volume also reduces quite a bit once it is blanched

217
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,800
# 塌下去了

218
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,040

Drain excess water

245
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640

For me personally, if you cook it this way

247
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,720
# 流失了
The veggie will lose all of its nutrients

248
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,120

Even if the dish looks good

So if you use Da Ye's method
