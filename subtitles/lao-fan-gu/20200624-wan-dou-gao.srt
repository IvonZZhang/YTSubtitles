00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,360

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,800
# 大爷你看这柿子
Da Ye, look at the dried persimmon

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,520
# 这个是没泡之前的
This one is not soaked

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
# 然后这个是刚才把那洗干净了 泡一下
This one has been washed and soaked for a while

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,520
# 今天我一看这柿饼我就爱吃
I already love this snack just because of the dried persimmon

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,400
# 你这是去皮豌豆 去皮豌豆用的
-These are uncoated peas. -We are using uncoated peas today

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
# 面点一般要的去皮的多 洗透亮了
We usually use uncoated peas to make pastries. Wash them until clean and shiny

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,280

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,440
# 慢慢煮上它 凉水下锅师父
Let's boil it slowly. I'm gonna put the peas into the wok with cold water, master

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,240
# 煮多长时间 煮二十分钟
-For how long are you going to boil it? -20 minutes

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,640
# 二十分钟要不够就半个小时
If not enough, boil it for half an hour then

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
# 咱们看自己家的火 放点碱
The time depends on your cooking stove. Add some soda

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,200
# 过去老的手法都放点碱
In classic protocols, soda is often used under such situations

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,360
# 不放碱还不好吃 大约有四克的碱
-It'll taste bad without soda. -This is about 4 grams of soda

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,680
# 有的现在人胃不好 产生胃酸吃豆
Some people may suffer from too much stomach acid after eating peas

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
# 放了碱就不胃酸了 酸碱中和了
-This problem can be settled by adding soda. -Soda can neutralize acid #这里化学上说是不对的...不过neutralize也可以有抵消的意思

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
# 第二条就是容易烂
What else, the peas become mushy faster (with soda)

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,040
# 它还有那种特殊的香味
Also it gives a special aroma

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,680
# 碱特殊的香味跟豆融在一起 非常香
The special aroma of soda fuses well with that of peas and smells awesome

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,480
# 在这我跟网友普及一下煮豆的技巧
Here I want to introduce you guys the tricks of boiling beans

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,640
# 我们煮豆的时候适当地放点碱 少放水
When boiling beans, you can add a moderate amount of soda, but add less water

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
# 比如熬一个豆粥 我需要一锅水
For example, you may need a whole pot of water when cooking a bean congee

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
# 但是我刚开始不要放一锅水
But don't add that much water in the beginning

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
# 放三分之一锅的水
Just fill one-third of a whole pot

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,760
# 一开锅了我就点点儿凉水
When it boils, add some cold water

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,160
# 开锅了就点点儿凉水
When it boils again, add some cold water

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,320
# 一直点到最后 我需要的水就够了
Repeat this step until the end, and there'll be enough water in the congee

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,960
# 这时候的豆经过冷激热煮
In this way, the beans are chilled and boiled repeatedly

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
# 它迅速的开花儿
They'll 'blossom' (become stewed and soft) very fast

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,920
# 所以碱的作用非常好
So the soda plays an important role here

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,880
# 这儿泡的是栀子水 栀子
-Here is some gardenia water. -Gardenia

36
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,800
# 过箩 这是为了给它调一下色
Filter it. This is for the color

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,680
# 大爷你看到没有 黄黄的水
You see that, Da Ye? The water becomes yellow

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,880

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,000
# 现在这豌豆已经开锅了 现在变成小火
Now the peas are boiling. Turn it to low heat now

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,480
# 一边煮着豆我一边切柿饼 切成丝儿
While boiling the peas, let me cut the dried persimmon into slices

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,600
# 咱们把它码上 码成一图案码上一花儿
Let's tile them here. Tile the slices into a pattern

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,320
# 它里面一般还放一些果脯 什锦果脯
Generally we use some preserved fruit in this dish. Mixed preserved fruit

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
# 这个蜜饯果脯
The preserved fruit...

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,160
# 在我们做食材的时候用的很广泛
is widely used in all kinds of dishes

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,920
# 八宝饭 还有其它一些馅儿心
Such as in 'Ba Bao Fan' (eight-treasure rice pudding), and in some other kinds of stuffings

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,760
# 好了 这个待用 这个待会拌在豆里
Ok. This is ready for use. We'll mix it with peas

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,520

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
# 这要过箩么 不过箩大爷
-Are you going to sift it? -No, Da Ye

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,240
# 要吃有颗粒状的 这个吃法有劲
-We are going to eat with these granules. -That's interesting

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,880
# 这会儿我倒点刚才泡的栀子水
Now I'm adding some gardenia water that we prepared

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,320
# 稍微来一点点
Just a little bit

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,680

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,520
# 豌豆一般 咱只要泡了之后
Generally... If you soak the peas in advance

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
# 第二天蒸可不爱烂了
They won't become soft if you steam them for a long time on the second day

56
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,360
# 而且就得现加碱现熬
You need to boil it on time with soda

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,440
# 稍微的这会儿点一点糖
Now add some sugar

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,680
# 这会儿点糖 先放了糖它也不爱烂
Add sugar now. The peas won't turn mushy easily if sugar is added too early

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,600
# 先放糖有时候糖一渍 我感觉不爱烂
If sugar is added in the beginning, it'll 'pickle' the peas, which will become tough

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,800
# 把果料放进去
Add the fruits now

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,360
# 其实这可以放很多不少的料是吧
Actually we can add a lot of stuff here, right?

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,120
# 主要是它得有青梅 腌的青梅
Well, the most important ingredient should be ome fruit. Pickled ome fruit

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
# 没有 没买着
But we don't have it here. We couldn't find it anywhere

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
# 行了
Done

65
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,240
# 我把这个 桂花酱 糖桂花
Let me add the sweet osmanthus jam. Sugar osmanthus jam

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,240
# 抹这一层 增加花香气
Smear it like this to enhance the aroma of flowers

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,680
# 而且它那甜口也特别润
Also it is 'nourishly' sweet

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,640
# 擓到里边 这豌豆一定不要熬太干
Scoop it inside. The pea paste must not be too dry

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,600

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,120
# 刮平 你看这跟豌豆黄截然不同
Flatten it. See? This is totally different from 'Wan Dou Huang' pea cake

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
# 能吃到豆的口感
as you can feel the texture of the peas

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,000

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,840
# 行了晾凉了下冰箱 歇会儿吧
Ok. When it cools down, put it into the fridge. Let's have a rest

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,680
# 定好了
Now it becomes solid

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,160
# 这在家里边 炎热的夏天吃上一块
If you have a piece of this at home, in the hot summer

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,680
# 尤其那小朋友
Kids will definitely love it

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:24,520

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,040
# 好吃 它跟豌豆黄有截然不同的口感
Delicious. It has a totally different texture from 'Wan Dou Huang' pea cake

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,520
# 那个是属于细腻
'Wan Dou Huang' has a more silky texture

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,880
# 这个虽然是粗
Though this one is rougher

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,160
# 但是它有吃豆的那种感觉 沙
-It gives you a feeling of eating peas. -Mushy

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,600
# 还有淡淡的桂花的香气
Also with a light fragrance of sweet osmanthus

84
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,880

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,480
# 我告诉你这要夏天 来这么一块 爽
I bet it's absolutely cool to have such a piece in the hot summer

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
# 晚上我把所有的兜
At night, I searched through

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
# 都掏出来
all my pockets

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,720
# 那是同事凑份子啊
That was the wedding gift money from my colleagues

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
# 最多五毛钱
The largest amount was 0.5 yuan

91

# 最少两毛钱

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,400
# 一共掏下来147.6毛钱
In total, 147.6 yuan

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
# 我说这是咱们
I said, 'this is the...'

94
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,520
# 今天开始过日子的家底
'initial funds of our family, which starts from today'

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,240
# 是我们今天生活的开始
'It is the beginning of our life'

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
# 大妈呢就是 我可不管这事
Da Ma was like, 'I won't manage that'

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
# 全是你管
'This is all your business'

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
# 从这开始
From that time

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,800
# 我就开始管家 治家
I started to take care of my family

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,360
# 我要求我们跟双方父母有一种约定
I decided that, we had a promise with both families

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,520
# 比如我们有钱多给
For example, we send them more money if we have some extra

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,640
# 那时候我们双方家长每月给5块钱
At that time, we sent 5 yuan per month to both of our families

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,560
# 我们俩人的工资总额
The total amount of our salaries

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
# 77块钱
was 77 yuan

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,600
# 所以给双方家长拿出10块钱
So it was hard for us

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,040
# 应该说我挺有难度的
to give them 10 yuan per month

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,520
# 因为我说都有小孩了
But when we had a kid

108
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,800
# 我再没有钱
We couldn't spare more money

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,040
# 我只能说有钱多给
So I could only say that, we send them more money if we have extra

110
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
# 没钱少给
Otherwise, we send less

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
# 再没钱我不给
If it's worse, we don't send money to them

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,640
# 但是我希望
But I was hoping that

113
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,320
# 你们双方的老人
Our parents...

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,840
# 是吧
Right?

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
# 千万别在这个问题上
I hoped that they didn't...

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,440
# 特别纠结
...feel bad about this issue (not sending enough money)

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
# 我也有难度
Because it was really difficult for me

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
# 因为我们俩人嘛
Both of us...

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
# 在家里头都行大
were the first kid in our families

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,520
# 我们还要给弟弟妹妹们
So we had to be good role models

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,920
# 做出一些榜样
for our younger brothers and sisters

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,480
# 所以双方老家
So both of our families

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,880
# 还对我们还是很谅解的
were very forgiving on us

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
# 确实我们有孩子以后
Indeed, after we had a kid

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
# 我们就不给钱
We stopped giving them money regularly

126
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,960
# 但是我要求
But I insisted that

127
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
# 不管回谁的家
No matter which family we visited

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
# 一定要给老人
We must ...

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,320
# 因为那边还有个奶奶吗
Because her grandma was still there

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,360
# 一定要给奶奶也好
We must buy something when visiting them...

131
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,280
# 给家里人也好
no matter for her grandma, or for the family

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
# 哪怕买两块钱的东西
even if we could only afford 2-yuan gifts

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
# 但是两块钱那时候也是钱
However, 2 yuan worthed a lot back then

134
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
# 能买好多东西
You could buy a lot of stuff with 2 yuan

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,200
# 你要买苹果
For example, if you buy apples

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,160
# 两块钱一斤
Apples were 0.2 yuan/jin (0.4 yuan/kg) at that time #这里我觉得应该是两毛？

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,640
# 能买十斤苹果
You could buy 10 jin (5 kg) of apples

138
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,160
# 但是家里人也知道
But our families knew

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,640
# 我们过日子也比较不容易
that we were living a hard life

140
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,720
# 能拿回4块钱的东西回来
So we could actually return with 4-yuan stuff

141
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
# 什么拿点带鱼
such as some beltfish

142
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,440
# 拿点什么
or ...
