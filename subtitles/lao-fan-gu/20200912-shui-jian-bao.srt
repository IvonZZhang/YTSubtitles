# 原料：面粉、酵母粉、泡打粉、水、牛肉馅（三肥七瘦）、胡萝卜、粉条、姜、葱、盐、五香粉、十三香粉、白胡椒粉、黄酒、酱油、香油、生粉
# Ingredients: flour, yeast, baking powder, water, minced beef (30% fat 70% lean), carrot, glass noodle, ginger, scallion, salt, five-spice powder, thirteen-spice powder, white pepper powder, huangjiu rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil and starch
# 步骤：
# Steps:
# 1、面粉与酵母粉、泡打粉混合，加水和面，醒发十五至二十分钟；
# 1. Mix flour, yeast and baking powder with water. Rest the dough for 15 to 20mins.
# 2、牛肉馅中加入姜末、葱花、胡萝卜丁、泡发的粉条小段，加入盐、五香粉、白胡椒粉、十三香粉调味；之后加入少许黄酒与清水，调匀；再加入少许酱油与香油；
# 2. Put minced ginger, scallion pieces, carrot chunks, soaked glass noodle pieces together and season with salt, five spice, white pepper powder and thirteen spice. Then add huangjiu rice wine and water and mix well, followed by soy sauce and sesame oil.
# 3、糖至半发的面揪成剂子，再擀成中间厚四边薄的皮子，包入馅料；
# 3. Split the half-rested dough into pieces, and roll it into sheets that are thicker in the middle and thinner on the edges and put in the filling.
# 4、按生粉与面粉一比二的比例，加水调成较稀的液体状；
# 4. Mix 1 part starch to 2 parts flour, and add water to make the mixture a bit runny.
# 5、点火后锅中加入少许大豆油，将包好的饺子摆入锅中，边角对齐；之后加入调好的生粉面粉水（水量根据饺子大小确定），先用大火加热至快收汁时转小火，淋入少许豆油；底子成型干脆后加入少许香油后即可出锅。
# 5. Heat up the pan and pour in some oil. Put the buns into the pan and make sure the pointy ends are aligned. Add in the starch and flour mixture, the amount of water depends on the size of the buns. Start with high heat until reducing the liquid, put in a bit more oil. The buns are ready when the bottom is dry and cripsy and can be served after topping up with a bit sesame oil.

# 就是先把锅给烧热
Heat up the pan first

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,760
# 放的时候一定要
When you are putting the buns in,

139
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,600
# 把角儿都给它对齐
Make sure the edges are aligned

140
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
# 出来的时候也好看
And when the dish comes out, it will be very pretty

141
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,520
# 二伯你看看 都听见滋啦啦的响
Erbai, look! You can hear the sizzling.

142
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
# 这时候就是什么
The next step

143
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,120
# 比如说水煎
Since we are doing Shui Jian, pan frying with water

144
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
# 就刚刚说了
Like we just said

145
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,320
# 咱们二合一的水汤
We have the two in one slurry

146
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,600
# 这个水有点少
This is probably not enough water

147
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
# 因为这个锅里边
Since the buns in the pan

148
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
# 因为咱今天包的有点大
are on the larger side

149
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
# 所以说可以多加一点点水
So we can add a bit more water

150
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,960
# 咱们大家在家里边做的时候
When you guys are cooking it at home

151
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
# 一定根据你包的水煎包的大小
You need to adjust the amount of water in the slurry

152
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
# 它的时间来确定水的量
Depending on the size and cooking time of your buns

153
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,040
# 比如你水少了
The buns might be uncooked

154
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,840
# 最后它不熟
If there is not enough water

155
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,040
# 它干了 水煎包
Yea, the pan will dry up. Pan fried buns

156
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
# 水煎包咱们叫饺
Buns but we call it dumplings

157
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,400
# 他们叫包
They call it buns

158
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,800
# 对
Yes

159
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,160
# 前期是咱们一定要是大火
Make sure to keep the heat on high at the beginning

160
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,840
# 后期最后收干的时候
And when we are reducing the liquid

161
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,320
# 再小火
Turn the heat to low

162
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,560
# 行 盖儿
Okay, lid on!

163
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,680
# 这样基本上大概在八分钟左右
This will probably take 8 minutes

164
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
# 小火8分钟
8 minutes on low heat

165
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,120
# 这时候咱们快
Now we have to move quickly

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
# 基本上冒泡的时候
As soon as it starts to bubble

167
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,160
# 快要干锅的时候
When the bottom is almost dry

168
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,880
# 咱们可以给一点点油
We can add a bit oil

169
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
# 这样的话色彩更好
To improve the color

170
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,320
# 好
Okay

171
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
# 就是说咱们这个火
Make sure the

172
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,000
# 一定要匀一点
heat is even

173
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,320
# 因为中间老是着中间就（糊了）
The buns might burn if the heat is always in the middle

174
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
# 所以说有时候在家里面
So you can make this with

175
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,400
# 用咱这电饼铛也能做
A Foreman grill at home

176
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,880
# 但是一定要把这个火
But make sure to be in control of the heat

177
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,480
# 一定要均匀 均匀的控制好
And heat up the buns evenly

178
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,440
# 不均匀的话
If it is uneven

179
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,360
# 它等于中间糊了两边发白
The dish will burn in the middle and the edges will be undercooked

180
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,960
# 这样出来以后
If we rotate the pan like this

181
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,680
# 咱们就全部都让它进来
All the pieces will have contact with heat

182
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,800
# 泡什么时候没了
The dish is ready

183
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
# 就好了
When the bubbles are gone

184
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
# 可以把四周的水分给烧干了
To dry out the moisture on the sides

185
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,640
# 面已经透亮 熟了
The bun looks clear, it is cooked

186
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,440
# 就差这底儿了
Now we are just waiting for the crispy bottom

187
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
# 来点香油出锅
A bit more sesame oil and we are ready to serve

188
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,840
# 出锅之后
Let's plate it

189
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,880
# 咱们给它摆盘
After taking it out of the pan

190
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
# 嚯够意思
WOW

191
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
# 漂亮

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
# 您得先尝尝看馅儿
You should try the filling first

193
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
# 徒弟做的怎么样
How did your disciple do?

194
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,640
# 嗯 香 真香
Wow, delicious, so delicious

# 十三香搁的好
The thirteen spice is perfect

199
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,160
# 十三香搁的好吧
I'm glad you like the thirteen spice

200
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
# 二伯尝尝
Try it, Erbai

201
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,000
# 您尝上面的锅巴是不是脆的
Is the Guo Ba crispy?

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
# 脆的 这时候脆不了了 都半天了
It might not be cripsy any more. It's been out of the pan for a while

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
# 这还真是脆的 锅巴是酥的
Wow it is still cripsy and also flaky

204
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,600
# 面呢
The wrapper?

205
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
# 很绵软
It is so soft

206
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,280
# 馅芯我看看
Let me look at the middle of the filling

207
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,160
# 你这皱眉头
Why are you frowning

208
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
# 我这心跳到这来了
My heart is all the way up here

209
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,280
# 是好吃的 还是好吃呢
Is it delicious or is it delicious?

210
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
# 徒弟在这等着
Your disciple is waiting here

211
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,160
# 心里面咯噔一下
Heart is racing

212
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,800
# 一皱眉头
When you

213
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,440
# 一皱眉头
Frowned

214
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,120
# 这边吓一跳
He was so scared

215
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,880
# 对
Yea

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,040
# 烫了
It is a bit too hot

217
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,680
# 刚才您说了
You just said

218
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,160
# 这牛肉的膻味一点都吃不着
You can't taste the gamey beef smell at all

219
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,200
# 你看胡萝卜
Look at the carrot pieces

220
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,320
# 粉丝
Glass noodle

221
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,680
# 你别瞧 食材搭配简单
The ingredients are very easy

222
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
# 还有很实用
But very pragmatic

223
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,680
# 它五香粉和十三香是揉在一起的
The five spice and thirteen spice is integrated together

224
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,640
# 它出一种特殊效果
And brings out another flavour

225
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
# 要单出一味
If we only used one of the spices

226
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,520
# 味道它就不够
The flavour wouldn't be enough

227
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,960
# 二伯点到实处了
Erbai, you are on point!

228
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,160
# 好吃
So yummy!
