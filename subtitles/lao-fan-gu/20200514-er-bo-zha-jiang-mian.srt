# P.S多的油可不要浪費，拿來炒菜吃，倍兒香！

# Introduction
# Hello everyone. People say that the soul of zhajiangmian ("noodles with fried sauce") is the zhajiang ("fried sauce"). Today, Er Bai has an authentic and homestyle old Beijing recipe that uses Huangjiu (chinese yellow rice wine) instead of water to dilute the sauce, so the sauce will be velvety and smooth.
# The sauce needs to be moist so it won’t be bland and dry, and the texture will be softer.
# When making zhanjiang, we need to be careful with scallions, too. We are adding the scallions in 3 different batches. What are the good timings to add them? Let's watch the video to find out.

# P.S. We can utilize the extra scallion oil to make stir fries, which smell and taste very good.

# 这三种酱合一

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,480
# 我拿黄酒 我师父这就不一样了

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,760
# 加的黄酒 黄酒澥

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,560
# 还不如不放 你要放料酒
If you have regular cooking wine, I rather not to add any of it

# 那就不对 也就不好吃了

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,520
# 因为炸的酱首先要润
When frying the sauce, first we need to make the sauce moist

# 锅热了师父 锅热了没事儿

67
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,640
# 水气出去 这个猪油也熬出来了

# 你看这油 油清亮了

# 这要是拿葱油炸的话就更香了
If we are using the scallion oil it will smell better

84
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,080
# 因为葱油里边含有香菜啊 还有香料
