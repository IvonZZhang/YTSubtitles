# 这道菜大师姐在山东吃过之后就再也忘不了了，满满蒜香。并且做法简单，几分钟就能做好。
# 小友们周末要是睡个懒觉，来个蒜泥拌鸡蛋，配上大白馒头和稀饭，这味儿，绝了！

# Hello friends, Friday evening comes again! This time Da Ye and Er Bai will share a homely dish from Shandong --  boiled eggs with mashed garlic. 
Da Shijie said she would never forget this dish since she tasted it in Shandong -- full of garlic aroma. Cooking this dish only takes several minutes, so it is very easy. 
It would be perfect, if we eat this dish together with Mantou (aka Chinese steamed buns) and congee, especially on a lazy weekend morning! 
At the end of this video, Da Ye and Er Bai will continue to talk about the usage of starch, so please feel free to leave your comments if there’s anything unclear to you!

# 你比如说过去说打蚝油芡
For example, long time ago, when mixing starch with oyster sauce

142
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
# 是吧
Yes

143
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,640
# 打蚝油汁
Mix with oyster sauce

144
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,920
# 那火似开非开的时候
When the water seems to be boiled but is not boiled yet

145
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,560
# 然后他还不能大火晃荡
You should keep the temperature not too high

146
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
# 是吧
yes

147
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,760
# 然后最后打完以后
Finally

148
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
# 最后它封油的时候
In the encapsulation oil step

149
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
# 你看封油之后
Then you will find

150
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,600
# 他用勺底下抹着封油
They encapsulate oil using the bottom of fry spoon

151
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,960
# 所以说这就是生粉的作用
So this is the effect of starch flour

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
