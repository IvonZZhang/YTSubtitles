# State Banquet Master Chef - Wuxi Pork Ribs & Braised Dried Fruits - Secret Recipe from First Chef of Jianguo Hotel

# 小友们好，二伯今天要完美还原建国饭店第一任大厨黄金元的秘方菜——港式无锡排骨！
# Hello everyone, today Er Bai is going to replicate a secret recipe from Huang Jinyuan - First Chef of Jianguo Hotel: Wuxi Pork Ribs in Hong Kong style!
# 无锡排骨原本是大爷最拿手的淮扬菜，二伯做的港式的无锡排骨又有怎样的不同呢？
# Wuxi Pork Ribs is a traditional Huaiyang dish, which Da Ye does the best. What makes Er Bai’s version different from the traditional one?
# 二伯的菜有一个特点，各种肉类的腥味通过素菜的搭配祛除得很到位，这样荤素、颜色和口味上搭配都非常绝妙，小友们可要把这点记下来咯！
# One of the characteristics of Er Bai’s dishes is that the gamey taste of different kinds of meat is ingeniously neutralised by the added vegetables, in which case, the balance of vegetables and meat, colour and flavour is just exquisite. Take some notes on this one!
# 今天是周五，大爷说再给小友们加一道甜品，让大家愉快地过个周末！大师姐带来一道老北京果子干，酸酸甜甜、清凉解暑，必须要学起来！
# As today is Friday, Da Ye wants to add a dessert for you to spend a lovely weekend! Da Shijie is bringing us an authentic Old Beijing braised dried fruits. It’s sweet and sour, and perfect for summer. A must-learn for you!

55
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,280

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,480
# 所以说我们没必要
That’s why I don’t think

57
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,640
# 再出水了
That we need to parboil them

58
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
# 这个不怕炸
They sustain the heat rather well

66
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,880
# 时间长了会不会把肉给炸老了呢
Will the pork be overcooked if we fry them for too long?

67
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,360
# 不会
No, they won’t

68
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,480
# 因为我还得拿高压锅压

218
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
# 无锡排骨的方法
How traditional Wuxi Pork Ribs are made

219
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
# 无锡排骨不炸
We don’t fry the ribs in the traditional way

220
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,920
# 为什么不炸呢
Why not?

221
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,680
# 他需要吃排骨的软烂
Because we want the ribs to be soft and tender

222

226
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
# 因为它拿油给炸了
Because the ribs have been fried

227
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,560
# 排骨保持着完整性
So they maintain their shapes very well

228
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
# 锁住水分
The juice has been locked in the meat

229
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,520
# 但是它瘦而不柴
They are lean but not dry

230
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,520
# 淮扬菜你比如说糖醋排骨
Some other dishes like sweet and sour pork ribs

231

257
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,720
# 又加以创新了

# 还有藕 这个藕是我刚才削的
These are lotuses which I just peeled

259
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
# 然后您看不变色为什么呢
Why didn’t they turn black?

260
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,280
# 刚才我在这水里边加了点白醋
Because I added white vinegar into the water just now

261
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,640
# 桂花 然后这还有糖桂花
Osmanthus. Yes, here is some osmanthus syrup

262
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,480
# 咱们网友在家的时候把这些都得洗洗
When you cook this dish at home, remember to rinse these ingredients

263
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,960

266
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
# 咱们这柿饼要拿手掰 不要切

267
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
# 把这藕咱们切一下 九个眼的
Let’s slice these lotuses. They are nine-eyed

268
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,440
# 咱们把这藕焯一下 锅一开就可以了
Then, blanch them and take them out as soon as the water is boiling

269
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,360
# 准备一盆凉水 这里边加点白醋
Get a bowl of cold water with some white vinegar

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
# 为了防止藕变黑
To stop the lotuses from turning black

271
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,240
# 水开了冲凉吗 不用冲凉里边有醋
Do we need to rinse them with cold water after blanching? No, because of the white vinegar in the water

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
# 普及一个小知识
Some facts about lotus

273
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
# 九眼藕含淀粉量高 炖出来以后是面糊的
Nine-eyed lotuses have the highest amount of starch, so they are quite glutinous after braising

274
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,800
# 基本上产在长江以南
They are mostly grown in the south of Yangtze River

275
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,280
# 北方的藕脆甜嫩
And the lotuses in the north are crunchy, sweet and tender

276
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,120
# 荷塘小炒那就得是用脆藕 它是七眼的
The dish Stir-fried Lotus uses those crunchy lotuses, which are seven-eyed

277
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,080
# 水也开了 山楂下去 这个先煮一会
Now the water is boiling. Put in the dried hawthorns first and boil them for a bit

278
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,560
# 然后把杏干下去
Then add in dried apricots

# 把冰塘下去 黄冰糖
And rock sugar, yellow rock sugar to be exact

281
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,560
# 咱们把柿饼给掰成这么大块就行了
Then let’s shred the dried persimmons into big pieces like this

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,520
# 一定要拿手掰 别切
Make sure to shred them by hand rather than chopping them

283
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,160
# 切的没有掰的口感好
Shredded persimmons have the better texture than the chopped ones

284
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,720
# 把它熬粘稠了就行了
Braise them until they are sticky

285
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,760
# 把这柿饼搁里边 全名叫什么来着
Add in these dried persimmons. What is this dish called?

286
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080

And yell “braised dried fruits”

289
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,280
# 您看这个水变这个颜色了
Look, the colour of the water has changed

290
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,000
# 把这藕也下去
Now add in the lotuses

291
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,760
# 这果子干有什么固定要求么
What are the fixed ingredients for this dish?

292
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,080

293
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,010
# 基本上就是这几样
Basically what we have here

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
# 咱这儿还有一个秘密武器 这是果冻粉
And we also have a secret weapon, jelly powder

295
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,880
# 咱们加一点水先把它化开了
Mix it in the water first

296
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,680
# 其实咱们汤汁已经有点黏度了
The juice is already somewhat syrupy

297
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
# 加上这个口感更好
It will have an even better texture with this added in

298
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
# 藕粉呢 藕粉也可以
How about lotus powder? It works as well

299
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
# 咱们在网上都能买得到
They all can be purchased online

300
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
# 咱这样就把火关上
That’s it. Turn off the heat

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,080
# 咱们准备了点干桂花 这点就够了
