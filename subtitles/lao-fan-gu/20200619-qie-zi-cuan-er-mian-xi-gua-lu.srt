# 因为吃茄子蒜不能少

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
# 砸点蒜泥也行 剁点蒜末也行
Or granulate some garlic minces. Or you can just chop some garlic.

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
# 这个蒜因为要生吃
We need to eat raw (uncooked) garlic,

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,040
# 所以咱们换了一个菜板
so let’s change to another chopping board.

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,480
# 生熟分开 米醋有没有
Separate uncooked and cooked ingredients (with different chopping board). Do we have rice vinegar?

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,640
# 这叫醋蒜 这要早点给它泡上 让它氧化
It is called as garlic vinegar. Mix and rest it in the morning to oxidize.

The oil becomes brighter in the pan.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,120
# 有的有油也有汤 发浑
Some oil might be mixed with meat juice, (the oil) is turbid.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,560
# 那个不行 出来以后容易腥
That is not okay as the meat will have unpleasant taste and smell.

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,600
# 你看这肉丁为什么要切大一点
The reason why we diced meat into larger piece

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,680
# 一煸它就小了 来俩大料瓣 煸出油来
is because meat will shrink during stir-frying process. Add two star anises, stir-frying until express oil.

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,840
# 把小料放进去 小料得足（葱花 姜末）
