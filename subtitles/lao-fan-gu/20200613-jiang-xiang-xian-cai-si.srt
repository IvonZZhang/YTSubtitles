# 【國宴大師•醬香鹹菜絲】比肉還香，在家就能做的小菜，夾火燒、夾饅頭，喝粥、拌麵條，都是絕配！|老飯骨
# State Banquet Master Chef - Soy Sauce Salted Turnip Julienne. Easy and Yummy Side Dish!
# |--------------------------- title should not be longer than this line ----------------------------|

# 简介

# 小友們好，今天我們的大師姐要給大家做一道家常小菜——醬香鹹菜絲，據說比肉還香呢！
# 這醬香鹹菜絲的關鍵還是要先把鹹菜絲沖水，洗盡所有鹽味，再把所有水擠乾淨嘍。正所謂有味使其出，無味使其入，烹飪的原理真是妙嘞！
# 另外視頻最後大爺為大家解答的問題：軟炸糊到底怎麼調合適？
# 出處來自軟炸魚條這期視頻，小友們可以去複習一下！⬇️

# Hello friends, today our Da Shi Jie (senior female apprentice) shares a home-made side dish “ Soy Sauce Salted Turnip Julienne”, even yummier than meat! The most critical step of this dish is to wash the salted turnip julienne thoroughly -- getting rid of the saltiness and then squeezing water off it, so called “clear food’s original flavor if it has; add new flavor if it doesn’t”. The principle of cuisine is really wonderful!
# At the end of this video Da Ye answers a question: what is the best way to make the batter for-fried stuff? This question comes from a previous video “golden and crispy soft fried fish fingers”. You could review it via this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rev4LJsvpfo.

00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,720
# 有味使其出 无味使其入
“clear food’s original flavor if it has; add new flavor if it doesn’t”

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,400
# 这你师父从来没露过这句话
I’ve never heard this from your master

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,280
# 把咸菜的咸味给它洗出去
Get rid of the saltiness from the salted turnip

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,040
# 有的咸菜还犯点酸和臭味
Some salted turnip even tastes a bit sour and fetid

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,560
# 它那个发酵的快 它必须得弄出去
Salted turnip ferments fast, so we must clear its bad taste

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,760
# 你准备料吧 这儿我给你看着
You could prepare the seasoning now, I will wash it for you

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,800
# 桂皮 大料
Cinnamon, star anise

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,760
# 这个还真不是桂皮 这是肉桂
Actually this is not cinnamon, but Chinese cassia (chinese cinnamon)

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,800
# 咱家里使桂皮就行 辣椒
Cinnamon is also okay for cooking at home, dried chili pepper

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
# 这个蒜拍一下 出味
Crush the garlic to make its taste out

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
# 它的黏液的全给拍出来了
All its mucus has been crushed out

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,600
# 料很大 下味足
Bigger chunk makes taste more sufficient

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,720
# 这是您教我的我都记着呢

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,280
# 葱段姜片大蒜
Spring onion segments, ginger slices, and garlic chunks

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
# 泡这差不多了
The soaking time is enough

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,480
# 咱们到关键的一步 大家看好
Here comes the most critical step, pay attention please

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
# 有味使其出 无味使其入
Clear food’s original flavor if it has; add new flavor if it doesn’t

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
# 这就是烹饪原理
This is the basic principle of cooking

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
# 咱们得把咸菜的水给挤出去
We have to get rid of the water from the salted turnips

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
# 我跟您说为什么挤这水
Let me tell you the reason

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
# 如果不挤这水
If we don’t do this

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
# 就是咱们平时的炒咸菜疙瘩
Then the dish would become an ordinary fried salted turnip

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,640
# 外边的味儿进不去 里边的味儿出不来
Because the outer taste can’t go inside, and the inner taste can’t go outside

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,600
# 它吸外来的味更加饱满充分
It will absorb more taste from outside

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
# 你给我照我给你挤得了
You take photos for me, and let me help you squeeze it

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
# 换师父来 你得照师父
Now it’s my master’s turn; remember to take photos for your master

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,920

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,000
# 师父就是师父 老厉害了
Master is really master, very awesome

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,720
# 行了可以了 别一夸您就使劲大了
That’s enough, don’t work so hard because of the applause

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400
# 挤完以后咸菜就变成这样了
Look how the salted turnip juliennes become after squeezing

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,480
# 成了干咸菜丝了
They have been dried

53
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
# 这个嚼起来比较有韧性了 有嚼头了
This makes it  tougher and more enjoyable to chew

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
# 这么多你看没了 看着多做出来就少了
So few now, they seem to be much less than before

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,640
# 咸味儿也没了 筋道了
And also there’s no saline taste now, they are more crunchy

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
# 师父师伯咱们开始炒咸菜
Master and master uncle, let’s begin cooking

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
# 这得多搁油 因为它吸油
Add more oil than usual, as the ingredient absorbs oil

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,960
# 咱把蒜子 姜下去
Add garlic and ginger

59
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,840
# 葱姜蒜炒香了
Cook until you can smell the aroma

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
# 如果家里边您要是有葱油的话
If you have scallion oil at home

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,320
# 直接使葱油炒也行 葱油更好啊
You could use it as the oil; scallion oil is even better

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,760
# 大料桂皮干辣椒
star anise, cinnamon, and dried chilli pepper

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,400
# 它出的是什么味 出的是肉香味
What does it smell like? The aroma of meat

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
# 咱们在家炒的时候一定给它炒透了
We have to cook it thoroughly when cooking at home

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
# 再补点油 这一炸料的油 它吃
Now we add a little more oil, it has absorbed a lot of oil

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
# 所以这油还要补一点
So we have to add a little more

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
# 这香味出来了
The aroma has come out

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,360
# 你看这辣椒还不能是糊
Don't overcook the chilli peppers

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,200
# 糊辣味就不对了
It’s wrong to have burnt taste

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
# 它得慢慢的沁炸
We need to fry them slowly

71
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
# 让它香味逐步的释放出来
To let its taste get out gradually

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
# 料香味 葱香味 姜香味

# 各种的味道全部出来 现在正合适的时候

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,600
# 咸菜丝下锅 下锅了
Add salted turnip juliennes

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,400
# 炒的多干松啊 整个油都包裹在上面
So dry and soft, that they are all wrapped by oil

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
# 现在拌匀了以后关小点火
Mix they thoroughly and then turn down the heat

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,720
# 记住这个是不搁盐的
Remember no salt

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,160
# 千万别搁盐 搁盐就咸了
Never add salt, otherwise it will be too salty

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,280
# 咱们首先是 搁酱油就行了
Firstly add some soy sauce

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,320
# 一百七十克
170g

81
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,040
# 然后冰糖老抽是必须的
Then necessarily some white rock sugar and dark soy sauce

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
# 这颜色必须得够
The color must be enough

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,960
# 得一百克左右 出来这个颜色红亮红亮的
About 100g, to make the color red and bright finally

84
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,320
# 黄酒来一点
A little huangjiu rice wine

85
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
# 再加点酱油
A little soy sauce

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
# 刚才是生抽老抽  这回是酱油
Note that we have added light and dark soy sauces, but this time it’s soy sauce

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,360
# 然后白糖再来八十克
80g soft sugar

88
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
# 别瞧这么多糖 但是它吃不出糖味儿来
Even though the quality looks large, actually it doesn’t taste sugary at all

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,040
# 为什么使这冰糖老抽
Why add white rock sugar and dark soy sauce?

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,680
# 因为它出来以后成菜颜色好看 它红亮
Because it makes the dish look better, red and bright

91
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
# 这烹饪的绝学在哪儿 你看
So where is the secret of cooking, take a look

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,080
# 挤干净了 缩了没味儿了
(Turnips has been) squeezed, shrinked and now tasteless

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,640
# 让它慢慢的把这汤汁里的味再吸进去
To make the ingredient absorb taste from the soup slowly

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,640
# 一会儿咱们有一步也很关键
There’s another important step later

95
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,000
# 还要放锅上蒸 盛出来
We will steam the dish; take it out

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,840
# 咱们拿保温膜把它给包上
Wrap the dish with a piece of cling wrap

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,600
# 咱们这保鲜膜是可以高温的
This cling wrap is heat resisting

98
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,840
# 为了让水蒸气免得流进去
It’s to isolate the vapor out

99
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,320
# 咱们这开锅得蒸半个小时
We need to steam for half an hour

100
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,760
# 这会咱把这芝麻炒了
We could cook some sesames in the meanwhile

101
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,120
# 锅里什么都不用搁
Add nothing in the pot

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
# 就直接把芝麻倒进去 小火慢慢炒
Just pour the sesames in, and cook them slowly

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,640
# 最好买生的
Better to use unripe sesames

104
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,600
# 因为生芝麻炒出来以后现焙 特别香
Because unripe sesames has strong aroma after baking

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
# 好嘞关火
Okay, let’s turn off the heat

106
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,760
# 一定得炒出香味来 这个芝麻油够大的
We must cook enough time until the aroma comes out; so much sesame oil

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,800
# 这咸菜蒸了将近三十分钟
We have steamed about 30 mimutes

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,680

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,280
# 香么 香 太香了

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,440
# 您看看放完冰糖老抽 这颜色多漂亮
The color is so wonderful after adding the white rock sugar and dark soy sauce

111
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,280
# 这个料头挑挑
Pick the condiments out

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,160
# 搁在一边给它晾凉了 装一罐里边封着
After cooling down, if we store the dish in a container

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
# 吃个一礼拜都没事儿  半个月都没事儿
We could eat it for one week, or even half a month

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,920
# 然后香菜 切中间连梗带叶的地儿
Then some cilantro, only keep the middle part with stem and some leaves

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,280
# 这咸菜凉了 芝麻多放点
Now it’s already cool, we could add more sesames

116
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
# 芝麻也是吃的时候再拌
Mix sesames just before eating

117
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,360
# 然后香菜也是吃的时候 现吃现拌
The same for cilantro, mix just before eating

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,120
# 这太香了大爷
This smells really good, Da Ye

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
# 油亮儿 为什么开始的时候
The oil looks bright, that is why initially

120
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
# 咱们的油得下够了
We had to add enough oil

121
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,480
# 这是空心的
The Huo Shao is hollow

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
# 我师父说了先给大爷
My master said, let Da Ye eat first

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,800
# 谢谢 谢谢 我先来一口
Thanks, I will taste first

124
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,000
# 我的天 你看大爷吃的香
My god, look how satisfied Da Ye is

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720

# 这咔嚓你看 这一大口
Look, such a big bite

130
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,880
# 这就是生活

# 上回您做了一个软炸鱼条
Last time you soft fried some fish pastes

133
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,640
# 他想问这个小苏打可不可以不加
People want to ask whether it’s possible not to add baking soda

134
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,840
# 没有小苏打可以用泡打粉代替吗
Can we use baking powder instead in case of a lack of baking soda?

135
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,520
# 可以
Sure

136
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,320
