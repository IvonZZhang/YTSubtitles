# 【国宴大师•层酥烧饼】国宝级面点大师亲授层酥烧饼酥脆绵软的诀窍！这些规矩一定不能少！大爷大妈的爱情故事(4) |老饭骨
# State Banquet Master Chef - Crispy layered pancake. Da Ye and Da Ma's love story (4)
# |--------------------------- title should not be longer than this line ----------------------------|

# 简介

# 小友们好！之前就看到有小友们说想学这层酥烧饼。但是大爷二伯也不是专门做面点的，为了让大家学到最地道的层酥烧饼的诀窍，这次特地请到了咱们国宝级的面点大师，上过舌尖上的中国的王师傅，也就是我们的大大爷来传授给大家！
# 做这层酥烧饼，你别看它个头小小的，里头的规矩可不少。谨记咱大大爷传授的这些绝招儿，在家里头小友们也能做好！
# P.S上期讲到了大爷大妈的婚后生活，这次聊聊大爷在中央党校讲课的那些事儿！想不到咱大爷初中还是个大学霸呢！
# Hello friends! Some friends told us that they wanted to learn how to make 'Ceng Su Shao Bing' (Crispy layered pancake). However, Da Ye and Er Bai are not professional pastry chefs. To show everyone the most authentic cooking tricks of this snack, we specially invited a national-treasure-level master pastry chef for shooting this video. Master Wang, aka 'Da Da Ye' (literally elder Da Ye), who once showed up in the documentary 'A Bite of China', teaches you how to make the pancake.
# Even though the pancake is small, there are a lot of 'rules' hidden inside. If you keep what you learn from Da Da Ye in mind, you'll be able to cook it in your home.
# P.S. We talked about Da Ye and Da Ma's life after their marriage last time. This time, we tell the stories when Da Ye was teaching cooking in the Party School of the Central Committee of CPC. Da Ye was an excellent student when he was in middle school!

# 你看看都烤成腰圆似的
See? Their shapes are like kidney

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,160

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,080
# 这一切渣儿都掉下来了
The fragments are falling off when you cut it

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,880
# 我们做什么都得规矩
We need to stick to the rules whatever we do

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,400
# 有的就胡乱扔
Some people tend to throw them everywhere

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,920
# 这个特别规矩就不一样了
It will be totally different if you stick to the rules

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,000

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,360
# 就这烧饼我们谁也没敢接
Neither of us dared teach how to make this pancake

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,240
# 做不出来怕不行
We were afraid of making a bad example

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,440
# 必须等您来
So we must wait for you

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,840
# 今天根据现有的条件
Today we will make use of what we have here

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,880
# 就让网友们能在家制作 现在开始
To show everyone how to make it at home. Let's get started now

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,480
# 我们把半斤的面粉倒入这里头
Let's pour half jin (250 g) of flour into this (bowl)

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,800
# 搁的中筋面
We are using plain flour here

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
# 四克的酵母  两克的泡打粉
Add 4 grams of yeast,  2 grams of baking powder

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
# 二十克的白糖搁在里头
and 20 grams of sugar into the bowl

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,960
# 那么热的天搁凉水就可以了
Now it's hot, so we add cold water

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,080
# 冬天可以搁点温水
In winter, you can add warm water instead

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,720
# 我们这水搁的是一百五十克
Here we add 150 grams of water

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,040
# 不能一次加满
But you cannot add it one-off

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,440
# 有的面粉干湿度也不太一样
The humidity of flours may also differ

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,720
# 王师傅在这个行业里边
Master Wang is definitely

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,680
# 是正经八百的国宝级大师
a national-treasure-level master in this profession

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,520
# 在《舌尖3》里边有王师傅的镜头
He showed up in the season 3 of 'A Bite of China'

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,880
# 大爷您知道吗
Da Ye, do you know

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,560
# 为什么我跟王师傅非常亲
why I have a very close relationship with Master Wang

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
# 您知道为什么么
Do you know why?

28
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,920
# 王师傅跟我师父是一个单位的
Master Wang worked at the same place as my master did

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,320
# 以后你就别当大爷了
In the future, you may not be 'Da Ye' anymore

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,680
# 大大爷这儿有了 你拍二大爷
We have a 'Da Da Ye' (literally elder Da Ye) here. You will be 'Er Da Ye' (secondary Da Ye)

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,560
# 这个面活好了之后
When the dough is kneaded well

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
# 咱们就饧一会儿 十五分钟
Let it rest for a while. 15 minutes

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,760
# 主要的关键得有酥层
The key of this snack is the 'crispy layers'

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
# 就必须得烫油酥
So you must prepare 'You Su'

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
# 开酥都是用素油是吧 对
-We use vegetable oil when making 'You Su'? -Yep

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
# 这个就行了 稍微晾一晾
This temperature is ok. Cool it down a bit

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,680

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,760
# 这时候再和 慢点儿啊
-Now mix it up. -Be careful

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,480
# 到这个程度就行了
It's done when it looks like this

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,280
# 拿过来咱们就揉
We can start kneading the dough when taking it out

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,800
# 刚才不太光溜 一定揉滋润了
It was not smooth enough just now. We must knead it until smooth

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,760
# 其实有好多面都必须得二次饧
In fact, we need to rest the dough twice in many cases

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,400
# 稍微再等一会儿 马上就开始了
Rest it for a while again. We can start soon

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
# 饧十分钟 什么都在饧
Rest it for 10 minutes. Resting is a very important process in pastry

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,200
# 不管蒸馒头 其实这个过程很重要
No matter what you make, for example, steamed bread. This process is essential

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,080
# 这过程大家一会儿看
This process... Let's wait and see

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,120
# 这个饧的差不多了
The resting is almost complete

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,320
# 这个面胀起来了
The dough is now swelling

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,760
# 铺点干面 咱们给它开长
Sprinkle some dry flour and let's roll the dough

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,840
# 越擀的薄层次不就越多么
The thinner you roll it, the more layers you'll get

51
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,040
# 我们做什么都得规矩
We need to stick to the rules whatever we do

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,960
# 别给弄成这弧太大就不好看
Don't make it too round, that'll be ugly

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,800
# 已经擀成这样之后 把油酥抹上
After rolling it like this, smear the 'You Su'

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,720
# 抹匀 要有刮板就好了 就一下就刮平了
Smear it evenly. It'd be good if we have a scraper, which'll do the job at once

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,960
# 刮匀完了之后撒点干面 这也是一小技巧
After smearing, sprinkle some dry flour. This is also a trick

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,480
# 一它吸收了点油
First, the dry flour absorbs some oil

57
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,960
# 第二层次更清晰了
Second, the layers will become clearer

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,320
# 这样弄完了之后就起这开始卷
Then, roll it up from here

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,160
# 卷的时候扥点儿 扥点儿层更多
Stretch it while rolling up. That'll make more layers

60
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,280
# 为了让它层更清晰 咱们就扥着点儿
Also stretching will make the layers clearer

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,120

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,280
# 你看看剂口让它在底下
See? Put the opening at the bottom

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,800
# 一定要让它拍一下
You must press it

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,200
# 都弄好了翻过来 手朝上
Then flip it, with your palm facing upwards

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,320
# 把这个掐上 排成队
Hold it tight and nip it off. Put these pieces in a line

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,720
# 有的就胡乱扔 这样养成的毛病就不好
Some people tend to throw them everywhere. That's a bad habit

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,320
# 剂口朝上一会你操作也好找
With the opening facing upwards, it'll be easy for you to find it in later steps

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,840
# 不给你找麻烦
It won't cause you trouble

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,800
# 这个就是剂口 剂子的口
This is the opening. The opening of this piece

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,400
# 我们做的时候要这样给它弄好
When processing the dough pieces, do it this way

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
# 你看把这个收好口
See? Hide the opening inside

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
# 这样就行了
This is done.

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400

74
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,080
# 要如果不找这剂口 你给搁外头
If you fail to find the opening, like, leave it outside

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,880
# 就脑门子都开了 崩了
The whole piece will be broken

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,920
# 一定把三个口都给它掩到中间
You must close the three openings in the middle

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
# 表面光滑了 收在一起
Such that the surface can be smooth and tidy

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,160
# 这才行 跟挤饺子似的
That's the standard. This is like making a dumpling

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,200
# 你看我发现大大爷一来 大爷就是歇菜
I notice that when Da Da Ye is here, Da Ye becomes silent

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,280
# 我在耐心地学习
I'm also learning patiently

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,200
# 你看看 不光网友能学东西
It's true that, not only our audience can learn something

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,240
# 我们也学了好多
We've also learned a lot

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
# 王师傅这回去我就能做了
Master Wang, I can make this myself now at home

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,240
# 但是没您做的好 我也能照猫
But not as good as yours. I can 'draw a tiger by looking at a cat'

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,240
# 这词儿用的不当啊
That's not the proper way of using this phrase

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,080
# 比着葫芦画瓢 这段话掐了啊
-You should say 'draw a ladle by looking at a gourd'. -Let's delete this sentence from the video

88
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,200
# 在家要做特别好做
It is very easy to make this at home

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,800
# 愿意弄咸的 撒些椒盐也好吃
If you prefer salty ones, you can adding some pepper salt. It'll also be delicious

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
# 一定擀成腰圆似的饼
You must roll the dough into the shape of a kidney

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
# 你们要喜欢圆的也行  这个就是好看
It's ok if you like circular ones. This (shape) looks good. 

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,360
# 这个网友要好好照您这学 真能学会
If our audience learns carefully from you, they'll master it

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,840
# 这没问题 这回去就能立竿见影
No problem. You'll be able to make it yourself

94
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,880
# 整个的坯子弄完了
The base doughs are ready

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,440
# 刷蛋液 我们是刷全蛋液
Smear some yolk-white mixture. Mixed whole egg

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,800
# 要颜色感 好看
That gives the beautiful color

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
# 这样做完了之后
After this step

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,040
# 我还告诉网友们 一定要把这个蘸上
Let me tell you guys. You must dip this

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,800
# 也一再告诉我们徒弟
I've also been telling my apprentices

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,080
# 有的时候蘸上就直接搁上了
If you start baking directly after dipping the sesames

101
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,360
# 这时候就滋滋剌剌的
They'll be uneven while baking

102
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,880
# 看着表皮就不好看
The surface will be ugly

103
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,640
# 我们一定要把这个研一下
We must flatten it here

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,600
# 你看在这研一下 特别平
See? Just flatten it. It'll be very flat

105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,480
# 特别规矩就不一样了
It'll be totally different if you strictly stick to the rules

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,800
# 就这一个动作 师父要不给讲
Just a simple step like this. If your master doesn't teach you...

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,120
# 这个我劝大家不管做什么都得做细
Here I would urge everyone to be careful with whatever you do

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,680
# 这个是生芝麻 烤得了芝麻还不容易掉
We are using raw sesame. They won't fall off after baking

109
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
# 你看这个特别平整 大小均匀这样就行了
These are so flat and tidy, and uniform in size. That's ok

110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
# 看着那么薄
Now they are very thin

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,400
# 一定让它胀起将近一倍来 再去烤
You must start baking after it swells up to twice its volume

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,560
# 要进五十度的温度的炉温
They should be put into the oven at 50 degrees Celcius

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
# 现在这饧着 行 这有五十度
Now let them rest here. Ok, this is 50 degrees Celcius

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,400
# 大家看一看 饧了十几分钟之后
See? After resting for about 10 minutes

115
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,760
# 已经胀起来了
They've already swelled up

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,400
# 在饧发的当中就不能乱磕了
During resting, you shouldn't bump it

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,320
# 如果啪这一磕
If the cake is bumped

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,640
# 它蹲下去 就再不起了
It will collapse and never return to the original shape

119
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,920
# 一会儿把炉温升到二百五十度
Later let's raise the oven temperature to 250 degrees Celcius

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,080
# 底火咱们可以搁二百二 一百八也行
The bottom heat can be set to 220 or 180 degrees Celcius

121
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,360
# 上火搁二百五
The top heat should be set to 250 degrees Celcius

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,040
# 因为小的（烤箱）就二百三十度
This small oven can only be set to 230 degrees Celcius at most

123
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,840
# 二百三会不会影响到
Will this temperature have a negative effect?

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,200
# 它就是上颜色慢 不能让它炕干了
It's just slower. However we can't let it become too dry

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,080
# 急火让它快烤 颜色金黄色
If we bake it at higher temperature, it'll be golden yellow

126
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,960
# 吃起来特别外头酥 里头绵软
The outer surface will be crispy while the inside is soft and tender

127
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,000
# 一定温度得升好了 二百三十度
The temperature must be raised properly (before baking). 230 degrees Celcius now

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,680
# 十五分钟到二十分钟 十五分钟吧
-15 minutes to 20 minutes. -15 minutes

129
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,840
# 如果要真是火急 看着有颜色了就ok了
If the heat is powerful enough, it'll be ok when it turns golden yellow

130
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,920
# 因为它是发面的东西 特别柔软
Because this is a leavened pancake and is extra soft

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
# 我给您盯着
Let me keep an eye on the oven for you

132
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,200
# 芝麻金黄 好 没问题
Golden sesames. Ok, there's no problem

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,680
# 一个一个给它敲敲 都动了
Knock them one by one. They are falling off

134
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
# 你看看都烤成腰圆似的 中间来一个
See? They are baked into the shape of kidney. Put one in the middle

135
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
# 切一个
Cut one

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440

137
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,120
# 外边倍儿酥 里边绵软
The outer surface is so crispy, while the inside is very soft and tender

138
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
# 这个做完了之后
After baking

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
# （密封好放冰箱）搁一个星期
If you seal them properly and store in the fridge for one week

140
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,680
# 拿喷壶喷点 咱们再嘘一下
You can spray some water and slightly bake them again

141
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
# 还照样跟这一样
They remains the same as this

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,640
# 让网友看看你看酥不酥
Let's show our audience how crispy it is

143
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,200
# 这一切渣儿都掉下来了
The fragments are falling off when you cut it

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,040
# 各位网友今天做的酥层烧饼
Friends, about today's 'Crispy layered pancake'

145
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,480
# 这几个关键得弄好
There are a few keys you need to be careful with

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,640
# 一个是烫好油酥
First, prepare the 'You Su' properly

147
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,840
# 一定要擀得均匀
Also, spread the dough uniformly

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,000
# 蘸芝麻时候一定要研平
You must flatten the surface after dipping the sesame

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,160
# 你看看这特别整齐
See? It's so flat and tidy

150
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,480
# 关键的时候一定要把它饧发好
Most importantly, rest it well

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,120
# 饧起来 在进行烤
Let it rest until it rises up. Then start baking

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,040
# 如果饧起来往这一颠 它就不再起了
If it's bumped after rising up, it'll never return to the original shape

153
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,600
# 所以这几个环节 希望网友们特别注意
So these steps... I hope that you guys can pay attention to

154
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,120
# 还有什么要求 还有什么希望
In addition, if you have other suggestions or hopes

155
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,880
# 今后跟我们说
Please also tell us

156
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,440
# 作为我们来讲 我们只知道好吃
For us, we just know that the pancake is so delicious

157
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,080
# 但是我们确实没有资格评价王师傅
But we are indeed not qualified to evaluate Master Wang

158
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,440
# 只有膜拜了 大大爷感谢您
We can only respect him. Thank you, Da Da Ye

159

00:08:23,200 --> 00:00:02,000

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,480

# 我没有受过高等的教育

170

# 因为我父亲对我的希望值挺大的
Since my father had a high expectation on me

171

172
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,880
# 就是学好数理化
'If you study math, physics, and chemistry well'

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,680
# 走遍天下都不怕
'You'll make a living wherever you are'

174

# 还应该考一个高中 上个大学

# 当时我刚25岁
I was just 25 years old then

188
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
# 我就觉得我在饭店里边干的
I was thinking that, when I was working in the restaurant

189

# 各种工作我都能干
I could do all kinds of job

190

So it should be ok

191
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920

192
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,640

But when I arrived there for the first day

193
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,520

# 排桌排椅
Sitting in rows of desks and chairs

196
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,200
# 上午4节课
There were 4 classes in the morning

197
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,160
# 下午实操课
And practicing classes in the afternoon

198
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
# 讲什么
What should I teach?

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,520
# 我没有这方面的知识
I didn't have the systematic knowledge

200
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,400
# 八一年也没有更多的
in 1981, there was not many

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
# 烹饪的书
book about cooking

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
# 烹饪的资料
or anything I could refer to

203
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,080
# 没有
Nothing

204
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
# 全是那些老师傅言传身教
All the knowledge was passed by those old masters

205
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,400
# 我就读商业部
So I was reading...

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,680
# 原来出的那六本书
The six cooking books published by the Ministry of Business

207
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,440
# 第一节课
In the first class

208
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
# 真是我冒汗了
I was sweating

209
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,160
# 我备了九篇纸
I prepared nine pieces of paper

210
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
# 我也想像人家领导人
Because I also wanted to talk like the leader of the country

211
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,280
# 那些领导讲话似的
Or other leaders

212
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,400
# 说两句再发挥一下
Talk about something, and extend to something else

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
# 然后再看看稿
Then look at the notes

214
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,440
# 再发挥一下
And talk about something else

215
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,880
# 我怎么说我这九篇纸能坚持半天
I was like, I could definitely go through half a day with these 9 pieces of notes

216
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,920
# 没想到是越讲 眼睛就花了
But I didn't expect that, as I was talking, I became dazzled

217
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
# 紧张了吧
You must be nervous

218
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,520
# 紧张了
I became nervous

219
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,480
# 没东西
Because I had nothing to talk about

220
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
# 当时11月份
It was in November

221
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,600
# 穿了一个毛衣全湿透了
I was wearing a sweater, but it was soaked with my sweat

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
# 等下课的时候
When the class was going to finish

223
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,520
# 说下节课讲什么
I was wondering, what should I talk about in the next class?

224
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,480
# 干脆讲菜吧
I decided to talk about dishes directly

225
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,240
# 九篇纸上午就这一节课就讲完了
So I finished all my nine pieces of note in the first class

226
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
# 我觉得讲菜
I thought that talking about dishes

227
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
# 对我来讲更简单
was simpler for me

228
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
# 可是说一讲起来坏了
But when I started, it was a disaster

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,120
# 我这前言不搭后语
I couldn't be coherent

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,920
# 比如讲一个狮子头
For example, when I was talking about 'Shi Zi Tou' (braised pork ball in brown sauce)

231
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,840
# 讲着讲着
As I talked

232
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,720
# 没准讲成油焖大虾了
I might switch to 'You Men Da Xia' (braised prawns)

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,760
# 就懵了
I got lost

234
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
# 但是我最后坚持下来了
But I went on till the last

235
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
# 4节课我坚持下来了
I survived the four classes

236
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,160
# 这时候我才体验出
At that time, I began to realize

237
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,440
# 我说以前当老师有什么呀
I had thought that being a teacher was not so difficult

238
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,880
# 不就耍嘴吗
It's just taking, you know

239
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,800
# 好
Ok

240
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,560
# 这4节课我是一耍完嘴
When I finished my talk after the four classes

241
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,360
# 上气不接下气
I couldn't breathe well

242
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,320
# 我觉得我特别亏气
I felt I was out of breath

243
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,800
# 下午开始实操了
In the afternoon, the practicing started

244
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
# 实操是我的拿手好戏
I was good at practicing (compared with talking)

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
# 可是见了那么多人在那现场
But when I saw so many people there

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,920
# 我紧张
I became nervous

247
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,480
# 拿起刀来哆嗦
My hand was shaking when I held the cleaver

248
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,400
# 然后就故意拍那案板
So I deliberately hit the chopping board

249
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,560
# 下午三个菜呀
I taught three dishes in the afternoon

250
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,240
# 三个菜
Three dishes

251
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
# 我也坚持下来了
I survived that, too

252
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
# 通过上课
After my teaching experience

253
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,960
# 我发现我的缺陷不少
I realized that I had a lot of shortcomings

254
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,760
# 有好多知识需要去完善
and that I needed to complete a lot of knowledge

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
# 有的学员说
Some of my students asked

256
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
# 老师这鱼蒸多长时间
'How long should I steam the fish?'

257
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
# 我那时候没有这方面的经验
I was not experienced in this way

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
# 也没有这方面的总结
I didn't summarize it, either

259
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,280
# 我说过两天
So I said

260
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,880
# 我再告诉你吧
'I'll tell you in a few days'

261
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,640
# 说炖狮子头炖多长时间
Also, when asked "for how long should we boil 'Shi Zi Tou'"?

262
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,160
# 我也不清楚
I was not sure, either

263
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,560
# 所以从这儿
So from here

264
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,080
# 我就觉得这实操里边
I realized that even in my practice

265
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
# 我的缺口太大了
I still had a lot of things to learn

266
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,560
# 回来应该还要进一步的好好学
I should study more carefully and deeply

267
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,040
# 所以我回来以后
So after I returned

268
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,960
# 到饭店上班的时候
returned to work in the restaurant

269
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,320
# 把我每天所工作的这些情况
I started to make records

270
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,680
# 都做一些记录
of my work every day

271
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,640
# 比如说今天蒸个鱼
For example, if I steamed a fish

272
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
# 炖个肉
or stewed some meat

273
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
# 炒个青菜
or stir-fried some vegetable

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,440
# 我都拿笔记
I was taking notes of them

275
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,960
# 所以您记笔记源自于这样
So that's the origin of your notes

276
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
# 记完以后
After taking these notes

277
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,840
# 我觉得对我是一个很大提高
I felt that I was truly improved

278
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,080
# 等下一节 我就这位同学
In the next class, I told that student

279
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,280
# 上次你问我蒸鱼多长时间
'You asked me for how long you should steam the fish last time'

280
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,360
# 我今天告诉你
'This time, I can tell you'

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
# 蒸10分钟
'10 minutes'

282
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
# 这个10分钟是
"This '10 minutes'"

283
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,320
# 我准确地通过我的实践
'is precisely summarized from my practice'

284
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,440
# 我告诉你
'such that I tell you so'

285
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,800
# 那位同学炖肉
Another student might ask about stewed meat

286
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,480
# 比如红烧肉要炖两个小时
For example, the braised pork should be boiled for 2 hours

287
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
# 也是通过实践总结出来的
Which is also from my practice

288
