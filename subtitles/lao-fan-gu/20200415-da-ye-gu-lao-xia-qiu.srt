# 能多用一次就多用一次
It would be great if we can even get one more use out of this bottle.

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,880
# 如果要求高一点我们还得搁个葱
If you would like to achieve a better flavor, we need to put some green onions.

Not now, but we will need some later.

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,040

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,560

# 要这个绿色 切成滚刀块
The green color will make our dish pretty. Now let’s cut it into big pieces.

# 别太多啊
We don’t need too many cucumber.

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,520
# 胡萝卜
Carrot.

51
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,080
# 也切成滚刀块 跟那一样的切法
We need to cut the carrot the same way as the cucumber.

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,440
# 胡萝卜为了一会方便
In order to make the carrot cook quickly, we will

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,640

blanch it first.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000

66

# 先拍后切 让它碎一点 蒜末
We first need to crush it, then mince it.

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960

# 这都行 叫一通百通
It all works – so called ‘master the one to master all’.

74
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,960
# 这就是传统做法是吗
Is this a traditional way of cooking?

75
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
# 只不过食材不一样了
Yes, but the ingredients are different.

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,080
# 网友在家里抗YQ
Online friends stay at home in response to the pandemic.

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,040
# 我们都在行动
We also need to support them.

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,800
# 行动什么啊 吃点好的
What could we do? Cook and eat something tasty.

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,640
# 胡萝卜焯水好了
We have blanched the carrots.

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
# 因为这虾里边有水
Because there is some water in the shrimps,

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,800
# 我们先抓点粉子 少抓
We only need a little of the starch.

82
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
# 葱姜拣出来
Let’s take the spring onions and ginger out.

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,560

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,360
# 抓点淀粉 让每个虾球都粘上
Then we add some starch and make sure every shrimp have some starch on its surface.

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
# 这叫水淀粉
It is called ‘starch slurry’.

86
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
# 因为它里面有水
Because there is some water in the bowl.

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,400
# 但是这个是不用加水和它是吧
We don’t need water to mix with the starch, do we?

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
# 因为这虾本身就有水分
No, because the shrimps contain water.

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
# 咱就别弄的太稀了起不到作用 挂不上
We don’t want the slurry to be thin, otherwise, it would be hard to stick on the shrimps.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,600
# 现在这粉子合适了
The amount of the starch is just about right.

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,440
# 下面咱们开始蘸粉子
Now we need to dip the shrimp in more starch.

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,240
# 打开了不打开 还得攥呢
Do we need to uncurl the shrimps? No, we need to shape them into spheres.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
# 得攥成小球似的
So that they will be shaped like a ball.

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600

95
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,120
# 咕咾肉用的猪肉 最好用点肥瘦的
If you are using pork here, you should choose the cut with some fat.

96
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,680
# 我们也可以用这种方法腌好了 蘸淀粉
For pork, we can also use the same method of marinating and dipping into the starch.

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,000
# 鸡胸肉也好吃
Chicken breast would also work.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
# 咕咾鸡球 咕咾虾球 咕咾肉
You can make sweet and sour chicken, shrimp, and pork.

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
# 因为它是球状的
Because it is shaped like a ball.

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,200
# 这叫先成型
We called this step as ‘forming the shape’.

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,440

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,640
# 一会要定型
Then we will help them hold the shape later.

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,200
# 好了 下边开始炸
Ok, now we can start deep-frying.

104
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,720
# 这油也是一样 别放太多
We don’t need too much oil.

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440

106
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,120
# 介绍介绍调料

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,840
# 这个不容易看到 这是白醋
and white vinegar. It is hard to show on the camera.

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,000
# 外焦里嫩 甜酸适口
The outside of this dish will be crispy and the inside will be juicy. The balance between the sweetness and sourness is perfect.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,960
# 看着啊 我们这个油差不多了
See, the temperature of the oil is about right.

111
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
# 咱们再固定固定
Let’s shape the shrimp again before we put it in the oil.

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,080

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,440
# 再攥一下
Squeeze it.

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
# 大爷干什么都那么认真
Whatever Da Ye does, he is very serious and careful,

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800

# 我这是从小攥煤球长大的
I used to shape the coal briquettes a lot when I was young.

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640

119

# 我可以俩手攥
I could shape it with both of my hands.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,680
# 大妈给看着锅里边啊 它在不断地变化
Da Ma, please keep an eye on the wok. The shrimps are changing temperature constantly.

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,920

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,680
# 圆呼吧 圆呼了
Does it look like a ball? Yes.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,280

Are we done? No, we need to deep fry it the second time.

137
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240

# 然后再来油温让它稍微调整一下
Let’s heat up the oil first and then fry it again.

Da Ma, could you help me to turn the heat lower?

147
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,360
# 葱姜蒜 胡萝卜黄瓜
Let’s put the spring onion, ginger, garlic, carrot, cucumber,

148
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,640

149
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,720
# 番茄酱 番茄沙司
And ketchup in the wok.

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560

151
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,520
# 炒一炒 搁上水
We now need to stir fry it, and then add some water.

152
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,400
# 番茄酱要多炒一会
If we are using tomato sauce, we need to cook a bit longer.

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,600
# 这番茄沙司不用多炒 因为它是熟酱
But we are using ketchup here, we don’t need to cook for too long, because it is already cooked.

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,720
# 开大火 咱们开始加调料
Turn on high heat. Let’s add some flavoring:

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,360
# 加点盐 大约四克
4g of salt.

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
# 要想甜 要加盐
The salt will enhance the sweetness.

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,280
# 白糖 搁那么多糖啊 糖要多一点
Sugar. Wow, do we need to put so much sugar? Yes, we need a quite a lot of sugar.

158
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
# 搁了这汁儿才亮
The sauce will be glossy because of the sugar.

159
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,080
# 不会齁儿的慌啊 不会
Will it be too sweet? No.

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,360
# 糖少了它不会产生气泡
If we don’t have enough sugar, the sauce will not be bubbling.

161
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,680
# 网友我们要是在家里做的时候说
Some friends tried the dishes at home and asked

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,120
# 这汁怎么出来以后不够亮啊
Why is the sauce not glossy enough?

163
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,600
# 就是你的糖不够
It is because you didn’t use enough sugar.

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,480
# 白醋 白醋也就两勺 两勺羹
Now we add two spoons of white vinegar.

165
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,080
# 有的可能说我喜欢吃番茄
Some people may like the tomatoes flavor:

166
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,920
# 颜色还可以重一点  再多放一点
You can add a bit more ketchup to darken the color.

167
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,480
# 现在这汁已经调好了 勾个芡
Now the sauce is ready, let’s thicken it by adding the starch slurry.

168
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160
# 是起泡泡了 起泡了吧
It is bubbling now. Yes, I said it would be bubbling, right?

169
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,760
# 这糖化了 所以你调出来这汁才发亮
The sauce will be shiny when the sugar melted.

170
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
# 看着啊 这是淀粉
See, it is starch slurry.

171
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,240

172
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,360
# 给准备一盘儿
Please prepare a plate for me.

173
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,680
# 这可以吧 那就可以了
How about this? It looks good.

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,520
# 看着啊 下去了啊 亮了
Look at it -  I put the starch slurry in the sauce, and the sauce is glossy now.

175
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,960
# 关键时刻
Important moment.

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
# 出锅了啊 好
It is done. Good.

177
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,080
# 倍儿红 颠一颠 蘸匀了
The color is bright red. Let’s toss it around, so that the sauce will be evenly distributed.

178
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,600
# 好了出锅了
Ok, we can take it out of the wok.

179
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,240
# 大妈给照一相片啊 那是肯定得照
Da Ma, take a picture. For sure!

180
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,560
# 真好
It looks great!

181
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,000
# 稍等稍等 调整一下
Wait a moment, I need to adjust the plating.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,120
# 酸甜可口的咕咾虾
Sweet and sour shrimp, it tastes really good.

183
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,120
# 它形状是球状 那就是咕咾虾球
It looks like a ball, so we call it sweet and sour shrimp ball.

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120

185
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
# 上菜
Finished!

186
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,880
# 家有大厨 就是幸福
It is awesome to have a chef at home!

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,880
# 我总也忘不了这句话
I always want to say this slogan.
