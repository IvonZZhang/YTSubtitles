# 用料超级丰富的卤汁搭配嫩滑柔软的豆花，入口即化、老少皆宜！
# 片尾附上大家一直想问的问题：调味品需要多少比例呀？盐需要多少克呀？
# 为啥讲了配料，不说用量，是故意隐藏吗？
# 今天大爷给大家详细讲解食用盐的用法，也来解答为什么咱不严格规定使用调味克数！

# Hi everyone, Tofu pudding is a traditional street food. It is made differently in different places all over China. Northerners prefer it to have a salty taste, while southerners like to make it sweet. However, Sichuanese are the most special, because they love to eat it hot and sour!

# People with different preferences even started a ‘War of Salty or Sweet’ online just to debate such matter. Today, we have brought you guys this recipe to make tofu pudding in traditional Beijing style, that you can easily cook at home. You can pick whatever is useful for you in today’s video, whether you like it sweet, salty, sour or hot!

# The sauce is rich in ingredients. Together with the smooth and tender tofu pudding, it creates a melting mouthfeel, which makes this dish suit people of any age!

# We have also given answers to the questions that you have all been asking, which are “What is the proportion of the seasoning?”, “How many grams of salt?”, as well as “Are you trying to keep the information since you only tell us what to put in the seasoning, but not the amount?”

# In today’s video, Da Ye explained the usage of salt in detail. He also addressed the reason why we do not specify the amount of salt with exact number of grams.
