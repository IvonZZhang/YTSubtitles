# 简介
# 小友们好，今天带来一道二伯传承了20多年的菜——古法蒸武昌鱼！
# Hello everyone! Today, Er Bai will bring us a dish he has been cooking for more than 20 years - Old School Steamed Wuchang Fish!
# 这道菜也是一道国宴佳肴，今天就教小友们如何在家制作这道菜！
# It is also one of the State Banquet dishes, and Er Bai will teach us how to make it at home today!
# 古法蒸武昌鱼的秘诀在于要放葱油，这样能在蒸的时候锁住水分，让鱼更加鲜嫩喷香！
# The secret of the Old School Steamed Wuchang Fish is to add spring onion oil when steaming to seal the moisture in the fish, and as a result, the fish will be extra umami, tender and fragrant!
# 也希望通过这道菜，能够传递出二伯的满满心意，祝全球的小友们都能元气满满，蒸蒸日上！

# 咱先给它改刀 先把鱼头给它拿掉
Let’s score the fish. Firstly, cut off its head

16

00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,880
# 借鉴其他菜系的一个特点是吧
That’s a characteristic of getting inspirations from another cuisine

22

# 待会葱姜给它挑出来
Discard the spring onions and ginger later

37
