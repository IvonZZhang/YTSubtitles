14
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,640
今天早来一会提前把这个面先和好
We come here early to knead the dough today.
15
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:20,920
因为啥
Why?
16
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,680
他这做胡辣汤需要什么
What do we need to cook the pepper spicy soup?
17
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,080
面筋
We need the gluten
18
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,840
早上就吃完这个早餐以后
After breakfast,
19
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,280
开始把面先给它饧上
we knead the dough and start to let it rest
20
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,200
饧了以后时间越长
The longer the dough rest,
21
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,080
它面筋越筋道
the more chewy the gluten will be.
22
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,880
我们真正的河南人做胡辣汤
Pepper spicy soup cooked by authentic Henan chef.

23
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,400
你看正宗不正宗
Try and see how authentic it is!
24
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,680
咱这个面和的时候
When we knead the dough,
25
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,720
也是高筋粉
Is it high-gluten flour?
26
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,840
一是高筋特筋的
Yes, use high-gluten flour.
27
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,400
您看这面饧的时间越长
See, rest the dough longer
28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
让这个面呢一定要和的稍微软一点
The dough must be made very soft.
29
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,960
要硬的话它不好饧
If it is hard, it takes a lot more effort to rest.
30
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,400
这时候开始加水给它洗一下
Then, add some water to wash it
31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
等一下洗的面筋水呢
The water we use to wash the dough
32
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
咱们直做胡辣汤了
Will be used to make the pepper spicy soup
33
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,760
这就是喝胡辣汤为什么滑
That’s why the soup tastes smooth
34
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,880
就是从这个因起来的
This is the reason
35
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,000
没糟蹋啊
No wasted ingredients!
36
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,720
大爷您看这配料也很全
Look, Da Ye, the ingredients are plenty
37
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,840
花生 黄花 木耳
Peanuts, daylilies, and black fungus
38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,520
粉丝
Glass noodles
39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
还有点肉
And some meat
40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
这什么肉啊
What kind of meat is it?
41
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,240
这时候洗这个面筋
Now we wash the dough to get gluten
42
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,600
一定要拿手这样搓着洗
We must use our hands to twist it, like this
43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,600
这样它洗出来就是滑
Only in this way, we can make the soup smooth
44
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,280
把面筋里边的面水给洗出来
We need to wash out all the starch from the dough
45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
洗完之后它才称为筋
What is left is pure gluten
46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,840
一斤面要洗出面筋能洗出多少
How much gluten can be made from 0.5 kg dough?
47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
洗面筋的话
Basically, the gluten
48
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,560
基本上能洗出来
Can be produced
49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
也就是四两左右
About 200 g
50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
在家自己洗
If you wash the dough by yourself,
51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,600
其实挺好玩的
it is interesting
52
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
二伯也洗过面筋 素肥肠
Er Bai has washed it before. (To make) the vegetarian intestine
53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,280
素排骨都得用这个
And vegetarian ribs. Both of them need it.
54
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,160
好
Ok
55
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,360
咱们先搁着泡一会
Soak it in the water for a while
56
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
咱们开始炒料
We start to sauté the ingredients
57
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,880
一会再洗一下
I will wash it again later
58
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,400
这样咱就好了
Here we go
59
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,480
这时候咱们把这个汤给它篦出来
Let’s filter out the starch water
60
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
留着 再洗一遍
Keep it. Wash again
61
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,080
再洗一遍
Wash again
62
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
啥时候把这个色给它洗的稍微发黄一点
Wash until the gluten turns yellow
63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,480
他是一边边的洗这样他才透亮
The gluten becomes bright after washing many times
64
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,240
把这个汤给他留着
Save the starch water for him
65
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,880
给你搁后面
I am putting it behind you
66
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,000
洗面筋最少得洗三遍
The dough needs to be washed at least three times
67
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
再来一遍
One more time
68
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
大爷您可以开水了
Da Ye, you can turn on the tap now
69
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,040
我就只能负责开水了
I can only take charge of the tap now
70
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,680
现在我这身子骨也就开水了
Based on my physical conditions
71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
河南在面食的发展上
Throughout the history of cuisine made from wheat
72
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,320
应该说是它是独树一帜
Henan has its unique position
73
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
这时候就开始发黄了
Now, the gluten turns yellow
74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,400
对
Right
75
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,120
大家可以看一下他的面
We can take a look at the gluten now
76
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
出来的就是精华
What is left is the essence.
77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,520

要是我们老家放我们老家那种
In Henan, we will add our special

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,000
豆皮丝也行

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
加点豆皮丝

132

这个也不是不拘一格 是吧
There is no limitation, right?
133
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,680
不拘一格
No limitation
134
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,840
有时候有什么蔬菜
Sometimes it depends on what vegetables you have
135
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
你想放点什么
what you want to add
136
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,280
但是海带不能少
But kelp is necessary

137
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,520
因为海带提鲜
because kelp can bring savory taste
138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,760
海带跟面筋花生这三样
Kelp，gluten and peanuts
139
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,000
是绝对必须要放
are necessary

海带花生还有面筋
Kelp, peanuts and gluten
141
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
这时候咱们调一下味
Now we season the soup
142
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,560
那么首先放胡椒粉
First we add some pepper powder
143
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,160
像咱们做基本上胡椒粉
The amount of pepper powder we use,

144
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
根据咱们自己
depends on our own
145
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,120
就是说口味
taste

146
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
因为原来最早河南做胡辣汤
In the original recipe of pepper spicy soup in Henan,
147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
胡椒粉要多
there is a lot of pepper powder
148
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,880
胡辣汤它没有那么辣
(The original) pepper spicy soup is actually not that spicy
149
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,480
现在随着生活质量在提高
With the improvement of life quality
150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
很多人很多都爱吃一些
A lot of people begin to enjoy some (spicy food)

151
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
早上出汗的时候怎么办
(They want to) sweat in the morning. What would you do if you want sweat?
152
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
那就得辣
You need to eat spicy food
153
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,680
这胡辣汤胡是怎么讲
Why do we call the soup "pepper spicy soup"？
154
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
胡就是胡椒粉
Pepper-- we add pepper powder
155
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,000
咱们再加点辣椒面
Now we add some chili powder
156
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,680
这是焙好的 熟的(辣椒面)
It is baked, cooked (chili powder)
157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,440
而且这个辣椒在锅里边干炒
Bake the chilies dry (without oil) in a pan,
158
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,120
炒完以后给它磨成粉
then grind them into powder

159
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
这样的话香啊
This way, they smell good

160
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,320
大家注意啊
Notice here,

161
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
这就是提前焙好的辣椒面
this is the chili powder made from baked chili

162
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
拿锅干焙
Baked dry in the pan

163
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,160
焙完以后再给它打碎
then grinded

164
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
为什么叫胡辣啊
Why is called “pepper spicy”?

165
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
胡椒粉的胡
“pepper” as in “pepper powder”

166
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
辣椒面的辣是吧
“spicy” as in “chili powder"

167
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
再加一点点五香粉
then add some five-spice powder

168
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,120
但五香粉一定要少加
But only a small pinch of five-spice powder

169
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,600
加多了他有香料的那种味道
Too much (five-spice powder) will overshadow other aroma.

170
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,760
太浓它就不好吃了
Too dense spice taste wouldn’t taste as good

171
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
而且他吃到嗓子
Also, if you belch,

172
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,600
就是一打嗝 还有那个味
the smell comes along.

173
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
所以说一定要少放
So only a small pinch is enough

174
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,760
大爷您瞧见没有
You see, Da Ye,

175
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,760
味道还是挺纯正的
it should taste quite authentic,

176
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
从它的配料来看
based on its ingredients

177
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,840
一定要少放
Add only a small pinch (of five-spice powder)

178
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,800
有一点那个五香的那种味道
Just enough to bring the taste of the five spices

179
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,280
所以我们老饭骨我们请人做菜
Whenever State Banquet Master Chef invites someone to cook
180
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,880
一定要找什么
we always find those

181
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,000
一是专业厨师
professional chefs

182
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,120
再有一个是纯正的本地人
and genuine locals.

183
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,840
本土文化的佼佼者
Local culture gurus

184
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,600
而且都是地方风味的一些代表
Representative of the local tastes

185
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
这时候咱们加点盐
Now we add some salt

186
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
怎么都得两勺盐
At least two spoons (of salt)

187
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
开锅咱们加一点点老抽
When the soup starts to boil, we add a little bit of dark soy sauce

188
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
色彩稍微淡了一点
The color is a bit too light

189
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
加一点点老抽
Add a bit of dark soy sauce

190
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,720
这时候咱们开始下面筋
Now we add wheat gluten

191
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
撕这个面筋的时候
When tearing them into pieces,

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
一定要给他揪着点
make sure to stretch them thinner.
193
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
你不揪等会太长了
If you do not stretch it thin enough, it will end up too long
194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
跟揪片似的 对
Just like tearing dough slices
195
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
揪出来片 它撇出来的大 滑
Gluten slices made by hand will end up bigger in size and smooth in texture
196
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
所以你看这种吃法啊
This way of cooking wheat gluten

197
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,520
还是挺新颖的
is quite innovative

198
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,600
这个面筋一定给它抻开了
Make sure to stretch the wheat gluten fully extended
199
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
它就是比较亮
It will appear very bright
200
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
还有弹性
and taste chewy

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,920
您看 面筋洗到什么程度
To what extent have we washed the dough?
202
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,360
你这样看 它出花这种感觉
Take a look here. The gluten piece appears like flower.
203
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
他不像咱们那种窟窿眼的面筋
It is not the same as the commercial wheat gluten full of holes.
204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
但它这个面筋等一会煮出来一样有眼
But this wheat gluten will have some holes after cook as well.
205
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,240
好
Great
206
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,200
这时候我把刚才洗的面汤
Now I will use the starch water we washed out from the dough
207
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,080
这回我明白了
Now I see.
208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,760
就是勾芡 淀粉
Use the starch water as slurry. Add slurry with it.
209
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,360
对
Right
210
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
这时候面粉勾芡之后
Adding slurry with wheat starch
211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,320
跟生粉勾出来就是不一样
is different from adding slurry with cornstarch.
212
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,520
滑呀这个 对
This is very smooth and silky
213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,760
二伯说的真是特别对
Er Bai made the point!
214
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,480
一是滑
It is smooth and silky.
215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,040
等一下咱们胡辣汤
Later, for our pepper spicy soup,
216
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,280
还有一个最大的感觉就是说
another key is
217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,040
不能用铁勺
do not use iron spoons
218
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,040
盛的时候用木勺盛
Only serve with wood spoons
219
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,600
这样的话容易给它澥
Otherwise it will become thin.
220
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,880
等一会咱盛汤的时候用木勺
When we serve the soup we will use wood spoons
221
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
没糟蹋呀
Didn't waste anything
222
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,160
对
Yes
223
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
物尽其用
Made the best of every ingredients
224
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
慢慢就稠了
(The soup) thickens slowly.
225
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,400
它比淀粉勾出来亮 匀 是吧
It is brighter and more even than slurry from cornstarch, right?
226
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,200
用您的话说呢
To paraphrase your words,
227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,320
稳 柔
smooth and soft
228
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
差不多了
Almost done.
229
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,400
开锅的时候把这个沫稍微的撇一点
When the soup boils, remove the floating scum.
230
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,480
把沫撇出来
Remove the floating scum
231
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,960
其实咱们这样开着锅它不影响
In fact, it is OK to boil the soup like this
232
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
它不像咱们做其他汤
This is not like making other soups
233
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
比如说咱们芡一勾完
Once we finished adding slurry,
234
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,280
那必须得出锅了
we need to remove it from heat immediately.
235
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,120
它这个没事 可以多熬一会
This (pepper spicy soup) is fine. We can boil it longer.
236
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
因为他放了刚才有花生米啊
Because we added raw peanuts,
237
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,120
是吧
right?
238
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,680
有海带
And kelp
239
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,760
他这样煮一会
We cook for a while
240
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,480
他禁煮
They can hold longer boiling.
241
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
你这时候看这个面筋
Now check the wheat gluten
242
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
你看就出来了
You understand now
243
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
越看就好看了
It is more beautiful over time.
244
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,560
越看越好看
Look better and better!
245
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
跟那花胶肚似的
Just like fish maw.
246
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
面筋发亮
The gluten is bright,
247
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
浮起
floating on the surface.
248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,760
这面筋煮的就跟一朵朵花似的
The cooked gluten pieces looks like flowers
249
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,520
来吧
Now it's done
250
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
这时候咱们放香油
Add sesame oil now
251
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,720
河南的正宗的胡辣汤 就中了
Authentic Henan pepper spicy soup, finished!
252
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,800
香菜
Some cilantro
253
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
怎么样大爷说说感受
How do you like it, Da Ye? Share some thoughts?
254
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,920
我看您光顾着喝了
You are so focused on eating,
255
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,440
话都出不来了
that you forgot to talk
256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
不是 我得品一品这味儿啊
No, I just need to savor it carefully
257
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,400
我这个照相摄像我手都累了
I am very tired holding this camera
258
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,840
是不是
Right?
259
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,440
首先胡椒粉的味十足
Firstly, it is full of pepper taste.
260
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,400
辣味儿适度
Mildly spicy.
261
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,120
大爷喝了两口汗下来了
Da Ye sweats after drinking just a little (soup)
262
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,280
咸 香 鲜十足
Salty, savory, full of umami taste
263
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,360
确实代表了我们中原大地的
Indeed, it represents the food culture
264
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
饮食文化的一部分
of the central Chinese plains
265
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,040
这面筋好
The wheat gluten is great
266
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
这一次二伯没皱眉头
Er Bai did not frown this time
267
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,440
喝美了
He likes it
268
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,360
你们要不喝这个
If you do not drink the soup,
269
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,560
后悔吧
you will regret it.
270
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,760
你后悔一辈子
You will regret it forever.
