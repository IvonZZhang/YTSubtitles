00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,640
# 先把馅儿做一下
Let's make filling first

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,520
# 第一  你看我们选的青虾仁
First, see, we choose blue-green colored shrimps

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,120
# 一摸很鼓利
You can feel it is firm.
8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,760
# 一会通过手法来打 给它上劲
Later, I will beat it with a technique to make it bouncy

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
# 我们给它稍微的吸一下水 蘸干了
Here we dry it with the paper towels

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,960
# 这虾线去了吗 去的时候也非常简单
Did you devein the shrimps?  Yes, very simple

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,360
# 一揪这小尾巴基本上就出来了

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,560
# 那么这个我们去好就不用去了
These have already been deveined

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,000
# 轻轻的一拍 给两刀 齐活
Slap lightly with the cleaver, chop twice, done,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
# 主要是要的大颗粒感
We want the texture of large shrimp pieces

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,520

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,920
# 切好虾仁咱们放一边
Put aside the chopped pieces

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,520
# 然后第二步我们给处理一下小料
Then we will prepare other ingredients

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,840
# 肥膘肉一点瘦肉都不要
Just the fat, no lean meat (this is pork)

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,080
# 因为虾肉没有脂肪
Because the shrimps have no fat

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,480
# 我们正常肥肉是虾是一半
The amount of fat is about 1/2 of the shrimp

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,720
# 那么现在从健康的角度来讲 我们稍微给它放成三分之一
Since people care about health these days, we will put in about 1/3

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,160
# 就这么大的小丁
Cut into small cubes

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,840
# 加一点肥膘肉 增加它的这种香度
The fat will enhance the flavor

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,400
# 笋也是切丁
Bamboo shoots will be about 1/3 of the pork fat

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,800
# 这个笋放多少呢 放肥肉的三分之一
Bamboo shoots will be about 1/3 of the pork fat

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,520

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
# 姜要切的特别的细
Dice the ginger very finely

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
# 但是不能让他嚼到姜粒 姜米
so people will not bite into any ginger. 
29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
# 葱也是 得嘞
And same with the scallion

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
# 下来之后我们就开始打馅儿
Now we will mix the filling

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,160
# 处理虾的时候非常有讲究
There is a key point when you prepare the shrimps 
32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,720
# 第一步盐 直接加盐
First let's add salt

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,960
# 除了盐之外 白胡椒粉
white pepper

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,720
# 盐和胡椒是先放
put in salt and pepper first

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,960
# 如果这个虾不是那么太新鲜的话
If the shrimps are not that fresh

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,480
# 可以加一点什么 可以加一点蛋清
what can you add? A little egg white

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,040
# 但是咱们这虾非常的新鲜 我就不加了
But they are really fresh today, so I won't put in any

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,280
# 然后顺时针 咱们开始搅拌
Then stir in a clockwise direction

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,040
# 然后我们给它稍微摔打一下
Then let's beat it for a little bit
40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,160
# 把胶性摔出来
to improve its bounciness.
41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,440
# 其实就是使大劲几下就出来
Just a few beats will do. 

42
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,520
# 这就是盐起的作用
That's is because of the salt

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,880
# 这摔到什么程度一定要摔黏了
How hard to you have to beat it? Until it's sticky

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,080
# 然后这时候另外把它加味（肥膘丁）
After that, add flavor for pork fat
45
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,160
# 直接单加 我们给它来点 盐
Add a little salt

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,000
# 糖 必须得搁糖
Need some sugar

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,120
# 鲜味汁 要不搁这个就腻腻歪歪
A little Maggi sauce

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
# 稍微的来一点生抽 稍微的
A little soy sauce

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,160
# 这个时候还有关键的一个 猪油
Some lard is important

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,520
# 也是猪肥膘的三分之一左右 三小勺
About 1/3 of the pork fat, about 3 tsp

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
# 然后我们给它进行一个搅拌 让它起黏
Now we mix again to make it more sticky

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,560
# 然后这时候我们把这个笋在放到里面
Now we mix the bamboo shoots

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
# 葱姜放里边
with scallion and ginger

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,840
# 你看我们这个馅儿 这两个都拌好了
Look at the filling, both parts are done

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,800
# 这时候再混在一起
Then we put the 2 parts together

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,880
# 这时候就不能摔了
No more beating

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,800
# 抓 下手抓 抓拌均匀
Just mix it with your hand until it's even. Use a grabbing/clawing motion

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
# 如果说要不单着弄这和不到一块去
This way everything is mixed evenly

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
# 肥膘也没味儿
and the pork fat flavor comes out

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,440
# 然后我们最后来香油 好勒
Put in a final touch of sesame oil

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,520
# 实际上香油调馅儿的时候必须得搁
Sesame oil is important for filling

62
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,920
# 但是要适当
Use the appropriate amount

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
# 主要吃虾的鲜味
Mainly taste the umaminess of shrimp
64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,080
# 盐糖 完全可以提出整个虾的鲜味来
Salt and sugar bring out the umaminess of the shrimps

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,360
# 这里边不放酒 会影响虾的味
Don't put in any cooking wine, it will affect the flavor of the shrimps

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,320
# 尤其是黄酒绝对是不能放的
Especially Huangjiu Cooking wine cannot be used here
67
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,400
# 这馅儿都好了 搁这儿搁这儿
Filling is ready

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
# 第二步我们开始烫面了
Now let's cook the wheat starch

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,320
# 咱们这是小麦提纯 叫澄面
This is the purified wheat, called wheat starch
70
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
# 我这准备了一点生粉
This is a little potato starch

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120
# 这生粉是干什么的呢
Why we need potato starch?
72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,560
# 比如说烫澄面大概是
To cook the wheat starch, it's about

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
# 半斤的面一斤半的水
500 g starch, 750 g of water

74
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,120
# 因为澄面它吃水特别的多 尤其是包虾饺
Wheat starch takes a lot of water, especially for Har Gow

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,840
# 有的师傅喜欢硬点的皮
Some chefs like firmer dough

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
# 有的师傅喜欢软点的皮
some chefs prefer softer ones

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,320
# 拿什么找 加点生粉
Potato starch helps with the texture

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,720
# 加上生粉软硬筋性马上就起来
With potato starch, it can be firmer.
79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,320
# 生粉跟澄面没有什么固定的比例
No fixed ratio of the wheat and potato starch

80
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,800
# 就一点 其实不用都行
Just use a little potato starch, or none at all

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
# 但是不用它筋度不够 稍微加点生粉
If you don't use it though, it might be too soft. 

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
# 一会在搓的时候我们往里放
We will add some when we knead the dough
83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,600
# 水开了 我们浇的时候你别一点点浇
water is boiling, don't add it gradually

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,360
# 你就大概齐一勺下去 猛一点
Just add it all at once

85
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,880
# 这样它熟的快
to cook it quickly
86
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,840
# 它这个澄面特别吃热水
This wheat starch can absorb a lot of hot water

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,880
# 烫完之后你看我们给它充分的搅拌
After adding the hot water, see, we will mix it well
88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
# 这会我们给它捏一捏
then we knead it
89
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,680
# 我觉得今天烫的比较合适
This texture seems fine

90
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,040
# 所以说生粉我先不放 我先搓一搓看
I won't add any potato starch now, I will start kneading and see

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,200
# 别怕烫 你别可着一个手这么干
Don't be afraid of the heat. You shouldn't knead it with just one hand,

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,400
# 你俩手同时 一下两下三下四下
you need to use both hands, 1,2,3,4...

93
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
# 它这样他就有一个缓冲的机会
so your hands can alternate with each other (hence, you will not feel too hot)

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,720
# 你看往里叠 然后这会儿这个面出来之后
then fold the dough

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
# 要往里边加一点猪油
add a little lard

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
# 一个是调节它的软硬程度
it will make dough softer

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,920
# 二一个来讲猪油它会更润
and moist

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,000
# 稍微加点猪油
add some lard
99
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
# 我看那生粉都用不着了
I think we don't need the potato starch
100
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,120
# 看这软硬程度还挺好 揉的挺好
feels about right, the texture

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,280
# 这粤菜里边澄面用的多
In Cantonese cuisine, they use a lot of wheat starch
102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,560
# 你看这个面你感觉它
you can feel

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,400
# 很利落 有弹性 软硬适中
the dough is very elastic and has the right firmness

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,120
# 这面就算成了
it's done

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,720
# 这馅通过冰箱的冷藏 软硬也适中
the filling has been in the fridge, also at the right firmness

106
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,960
# 胡萝卜丁可以焯水 也可以不焯水
you can blanch the carrot pieces or not, put them in right before wrapping

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
# 什么时候包再往里放 因为胡萝卜出水
Add it in when you start making the dumpling, because carrot leaks its juice
108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
# 我们就直接放里边了
I am putting them in

109
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
# （去皮）小青豆 这也得焯水
and the peas, need to blanch as well. 

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,280
# 也是给串色用
for color
111
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,080
# 师父 下边我们开始包了
Now we will start wrapping

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,120
# 这个包虾饺是粤菜面点里边 非常讲究技术的这么一个活儿
This wrapping part demands high skills

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,440
# 首先先取一块澄面
Take a small piece of the dough

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,280
# 三下 三下一张皮
3 slaps, (only need) 3 slaps to make one wrapper
115
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,840
# 这个关键点是什么 备块毛巾
What's the key point here? Prepare a towel

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,800
# 然后我们用专门的拍皮刀
Use a special cleaver for making wrappers

117
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,520
# 上边一定要刷点油 让它有一点油性
put some oil on your towel

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,480

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,800
# 刀上弄点油之后是光的
The cleaver will be shiny with the oil

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
# 按一下 你看
press it, see

121
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
# 上面有油 底下没油
it has oil on the surface, but no oil on the bottom
122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
# 你看这就是棒 倍儿圆
See, that's great! so round
124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,480
# 这比擀出来的皮可圆
It's rounder than a rolled wrapper

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,600

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,240
# 包的时候 油面朝外不油面朝里
When you wrap the dumpling, the oiled side is facing out

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,280
# 搅拌一下
mix it
128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,640
# 网友朋友们 包虾饺的技术
Friends, you can practice these skills

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,400
# 在家没事就可以练一练
at home with your free time

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,840
# 上馅儿之后往一边走
Put the filling in and wrap in one direction

131
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,560

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,800
# 这个包是这么包 横着推用手指头肚
It's like this, push with the belly of your finger

133
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,480
# 往上捻  捻之后
and pull slightly, then seal the fold

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,960
# 这个捻 这个往上跟
when you seal it with one hand, pull the edge with another hand. 
135
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,600

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,080
# 然后边儿我们给它拿捏一下
finally we press it

137
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,320
# 怎么办呢 去掉
then trim it

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
# 一个 行了
One done.
139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
# 又一个
one more

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,760
# 那么咱们用家里的刀咱们试试
Now we use a regular cleaver
