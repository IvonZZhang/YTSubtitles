# 前两期节目我说过这个

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,280
# 比如熬一锅粥 先放少半锅水
For example, if you are making a pot of congee, you should start with less than half of a pot of water

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,120
# 火还不能开太大 给它一个加热时间
Also make sure the heat is not too high, you want to give it some time to come up to temperature

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
# 一开锅点点儿凉水
Add a little bit of cold water into the pot as soon as it starts to boil

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,520
# 通过热胀冷缩 这豆很快就开花
Because heat expand and cold contracts, this will allow the beans to burst from its skin very quickly

25

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,040
# 开锅喽 再看看

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,640
# 这汤留着 冰镇一下多棒 你看开花了
You can keep the poaching liquid, chill it in the fridge and it will be delicious. Look at how the beans burst from their skins

33

# 原汤还得留着 你看全张嘴了
We need to keep the poaching liquid. Look, all the beans burst from their skins

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
# 咱为了提高速度（过凉水）
For time purposes we are running the beans under cold water

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,920
# 应该是晾凉
The proper way is to let it cool by itself

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,440
# 可以把冰糖放进去了 让它化着
You can add white rock sugar now, let it melt on its own

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,000
# 这水就不要了大爷
Da Ye we don’t need to add extra water into the blender

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,560
# 少来 要不你转不起来
Just add a little touch, otherwise the blender will have a hard time blending.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
# 倒出一盆里头 一会胎菊水搁进去 真棒
Place the puree into a big bowl, we will add the chrysanthemum water later, it will be extraordinary

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,680
# 好过箩
Ok, lets pass the puree through the sieve

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
# 为什么这可以用手你知道吗
Do you know why we can use our hands for this?

45

# 一会还得加热
Because we are going to heat this up again

46
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,960
# 这可千万别倒 擓两勺熬粥 千万别糟蹋
Do not through this away (thick mung bean paste), you can add two spoons of this when making porridge, please don’t waste it

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,320
# 你要是不放冰箱也行
It is alright if you don’t put this (thick mung bean paste) inside a fridge

# 大爷都搁里了啊
Da Ye poured all of it into the wok

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,120
# 过出这绿豆沙来 下锅还要勾一点芡
After adding the sieved mung bean puree, we still need to add some slurry

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,240
# 搁点淀粉或者糯米粉
Add some starch or sticky rice powder

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,960
# 不勾芡不行 它沉底儿 融不了
Adding slurry is a must, otherwise all the solid will sink to the bottom and will not mix well together

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,120

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,280

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,160
# 这种喝起来就比较柔 比较爽
This kind of consistency is very silky when drinking, very refreshing

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,240
# 当我们要冷冻（冷藏）了以后

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
# 它比现在还要稠一些
Its consistency will be a bit thicker

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,000
# 也别太多 就是两克到三克
you do not need too much, 2-3 grams should do the trick

132
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,440
# 然后我们盖上锅盖
Now place the lid on

133
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,080
# 前两期节目我说过这个
I discussed about this 2 shows ago

134
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,280
# 比如熬一锅粥 先放少半锅水
For example, if you are making a pot of congee, you should start with less than half of a pot of water

135
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,120
# 火还不能开太大 给它一个加热时间
Also make sure the heat is not too high, you want to give it some time to come up to temperature

136
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
# 一开锅点点儿凉水
Add a little bit of cold water into the pot as soon as it starts to boil

137
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,520
# 通过热胀冷缩 这豆很快就开花
Because heat expand and cold contracts, this will allow the beans to burst from its skin very quickly

138
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,440
# 开了吧 少加点凉水
It is starting to boil now, let’s add a little bit of cold water

139
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,160
# 火可以关小一点 让它慢慢开
You can turn the heat lower, let it boil gently

140
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,240
# 我看有点发浑了
I can see that the water is getting a bit cloudy now

141
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,640
# 说明这豆有开嘴儿的了
This means some mung beans is starting to burst from their skins

142
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,280
# 就慢慢煮着吧别着急
Just let it boil, don’t rush

143
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,760
# 刚强来 掀锅 又加一次 这就差不多了
Gangqiang, open the lid and add some cold water again, this should do it

144
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,040
# 开锅喽 再看看
The mung beans are cooked, have a look

145
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,640
# 这汤留着 冰镇一下多棒 你看开花了
You can keep the poaching liquid, chill it in the fridge and it will be delicious. Look at how the beans burst from their skins

146
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480

147
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,040
# 先把豆捞出来
Darin out the mung beans first

148
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,480
# 原汤还得留着 你看全张嘴了
We need to keep the poaching liquid. Look, all the beans burst from their skins

149
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
# 咱为了提高速度（过凉水）
For time purposes we are running the beans under cold water

150
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,920
# 应该是晾凉
The proper way is to let it cool by itself

151
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,440
# 可以把冰糖放进去了 让它化着
You can add white rock sugar now, let it melt on its own

152
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,000
# 这水就不要了大爷
Da Ye we don’t need to add extra water into the blender

153
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,560
# 少来 要不你转不起来
Just add a little touch, otherwise the blender will have a hard time blending.

154
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280

155
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
# 倒出一盆里头 一会胎菊水搁进去 真棒
Place the puree into a big bowl, we will add the chrysanthemum water later, it will be extraordinary

156
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,680
# 好过箩
Ok, lets pass the puree through the sieve

157
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
# 为什么这可以用手你知道吗
Do you know why we can use our hands for this?

158
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,520
# 一会还得加热
Because we are going to heat this up again

159
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,960
# 这可千万别倒 擓两勺熬粥 千万别糟蹋
Do not through this away (thick mung bean paste), you can add two spoons of this when making porridge, please don’t waste it

160
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,320
# 你要是不放冰箱也行
It is alright if you don’t put this (thick mung bean paste) inside a fridge

161
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,440
# 放三天就是麻豆腐了 豆汁也出来了
Let it sit in room temperature for 3 days and you will have fermented bean dregs and fermented bean juice

162
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
# 绝对是好东西 真的
This is some really good stuff

163
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,760
# 这可以下锅了
This is ready to go into the wok now

164
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
# 大爷你看 胎菊水
Da Ye look, chrysanthemum water

165
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,400
# 大爷都搁里了啊
Da Ye poured all of it into the wok

166
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,120
# 过出这绿豆沙来 下锅还要勾一点芡
After adding the sieved mung bean puree, we still need to add some slurry

167
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,240
# 搁点淀粉或者糯米粉
Add some starch or sticky rice powder

168
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,960
# 不勾芡不行 它沉底儿 融不了
Adding slurry is a must, otherwise all the solid will sink to the bottom and will not mix well together

169
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,120

170
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,280
# 藕粉糯米粉都行
Lotus root powder and stick rice powder both works

171
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,440
# 拢到什么程度就是米汤芡儿
Stir until the soup is at a similar consistency as rice congee

172
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,160
# 这种喝起来就比较柔 比较爽
This kind of consistency is very silky when drinking, very refreshing

173
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,240
# 当我们要冷冻（冷藏）了以后
If we decide refrigerate this

174
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
# 它比现在还要稠一些
Its consistency will be a bit thicker

175
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,600
# 藕粉 菱角粉 马蹄粉 糯米粉
Lotus root powder, water caltrop powder, water chestnut powder, sticky rice powder

176
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
# 家里有什么都行
Use whatever you got at home

177
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,200
# 倒这盆里就行
This bowl will do

178
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,600

179
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,280
# 先晾晾
Let it cool first

180
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,880
# 冰箱里边晾的差不多了 倍儿柔
It is almost completely cooled being inside the fridge, it became extremely silky

181
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,840

182

# 胎菊绿豆爽
Mung bean soup seasoned with chrysanthemum

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,040

184
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,920
# 大爷您尝尝
Da Ye, please have a taste

185
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,480

186
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,840
# 一饮而尽
“finished the entire bowl in one gulp”

187
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
# 细腻滑爽
Fine and smooth

188
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
# 菊香味浓

# 喝完这个 给大家降降火
Drink this will help everyone to ease their heatiness

191

# 降降温 排排毒
Ease the heatiness, Cleansing the body

192
00:03:24,960 --> 00:00:02,000

193
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,480
# 炒拔丝（糖）之前
Before making any syrup coating dish

194
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,640
# 要把原材料都炸好
All the ingredients need to be pre-fried

195
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
# 炸成半成品
Fried until it is semi-finished

196
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
# 就先定型
so its shape is fixed

197
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,640
# 当糖一入锅的时候
As soon as the sugar goes into the wok

198
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
# 同时要把油锅也要升温
Turn up the heat for the deep-frying pan simultaneously

199
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
# 等这糖一旦炒好了
When the sugar in the pan is fully melted

200
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,840
# 然后把该炸的原料二次复炸
Start the second frying of the ingredients

201
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
# （复）炸完以后
After the ingredients are done frying for the second time

202
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
# 这糖色还没炒（好）呢
The sugar will still not yet be fully caramelized

203
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,400
# 要控油（原料）
Drain the oil out of the ingredients

204
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
# 等这糖色到这节点上了
Wait until the sugar are fully caramelized

205
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,720
# 迅速的把原料倒入拔丝锅里了
Quickly add the ingredients to the wok with caramelized sugar

206
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,160
# 翻锅的时候要离火
Make sure the wok is not in contact with any heat when tossing

207
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
# 一点一点翻
Toss the wok little by little

208
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
# 不能翻完了翻匀了
You cannot stop tossing even when all the ingredients are evenly coated with syrup

209
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,880
# 就倒入盘里了也不行
Do not put it into the plate immediately as well

210
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,120
# 翻一翻
Keep tossing

211
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,280
# 让他降低温度
Let the ingredients cool down a little in the wok

212
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,760
# 然后锅底下糖逐渐都包裹在原料上
so all the syrup that are at the bottom of the wok covers the ingredient gradually and evenly

213
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,280
# 这个时候再出盘
Only plate when you reach this stage

214
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,600
# 如果你出盘太早
If you plate too early

215
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
# 装到盘里了
As soon as the ingredients goes onto the plate

216
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
# 那糖全留到盘底下去了
the syrup will run down from the ingredients and settle all on to the plate

217
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,160
# 原料上没有糖
There will be no sugar left on the ingredients

218
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,520
# 所以要有时候
So sometimes

219
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
# 甚至于我们旁边
We can even ask someone to stand next to us

220
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
# 还有帮忙的
so they can help us

221
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,080
# 拿个扇子
Grab a fan

222
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,960
# 呼呼扇两下让它降温
Use the fan to make it cool down

223
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,920
# 降温的目的
The purpose of cooling it down

224
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
# 让糖均匀的裹在原料上
Is to let the sugar settles on to the ingredient more evenly

225
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,280
# 出来的效果就更好一些
So the end result would be better

226
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
